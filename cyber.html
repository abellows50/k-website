  <h2>Terminal-Fu</h2>
  <p><img src="img/terminalfu.jpg" alt=""> </p>
  <h3>the -fu suffix:</h3>
  <p>From: <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-fu">https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-fu</a> </p>
  <p>-fu : (slang) Used to form nouns indicating expertise or mastery of specified skill or area of knowledge.</p>
  <ul>
    â€Ž<li>Google + â€Ž-fu â†’ â€ŽGoogle-fu
    â€Ž<li>script + â€Ž-fu â†’ â€Žscript-fu
    <li>My Google-fu is weak!
    <li>Aragorn uses Ranger-fu to figure out that Sam and Frodo have taken a boat.
  </ul>
  <h4>Etymology</h4>
  <p>From kung-fu.</p>


  <h3>Some extra Resources</h3>
  <p><a href="https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview">https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview</a></p>
  <p>What is a terminal emulator based on? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT100">VT100 Terminal</a> </p>
  <p>Terminal Emulators: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_terminal_emulators">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_terminal_emulators</a> </p>


  <h3>Terminal vs Shell</h3>
  <p>Terminal and shell are often used interchangeably much like arguments vs parameters.</p>
  <p>The terminal (Actually a terminal emulator) is the window that connects to another machine. This is based on a physical device called a terminal.</p>
  <p>The shell is the program running on the machine that is parsing your commands.</p>


  <h3>Common Problems</h3>
  <p>Often typing commands that you know, will cause results you do not expect.</p>
  <p>Echo is a simple command that prints to the terminal whatever text you give it.</p>
  <pre class="codeblock"><code>
  $ echo hello, goodbye
  hello, goodbye
  $ echo "hello, goodbye"
  hello, goodbye
  $</code></pre>
  <p>But if you mistype it:</p>
  <pre class="codeblock"><code>
  $ echo "hello, goodbye
  ></code></pre>
  <p>Oh No! You are stuck! </p>
  <p>There are several ways to fix this. One is to close your quotations, the other is to press Ctrl-C and ending the command.</p>
  <h3>Your 2nd best friend: ctrl-c</h3>
  Here are some examples of commands that will make your terminal get stuck in some way:
  <ul>
    <li>$ echo "hello</li>
    <li>$ grep foobar</li>
    <li>$ yes</li>
    <li>$ tail</li>
    <li>$ cat</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In every case, the solution is the same: hit Ctrl-C (pronounced "control-see"). Ctrl-C is sometimes written as âŒƒC</p>

  <h3>Your best friend: Tab (the key above capslock)</h3>
  <p>When typing commands into the shell, many shells will allow for some form of autocompletion. The tab key triggers the auto complete functionality.</p>

  <h3>Other tools that you should know:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>cd</li>
    <li>cp and mv</li>
    <li>scp</li>
    <li>cat</li>
    <li>nano / micro</li>
    <li>ssh</li>
    <li>If you like to suffer:  vim , emacs</li>
  </ul>




  <h3>SSH</h3>
  <p>ssh is a secure shell program that lets you connect your terminal to a shell on a remote computer.
     This is used to run commands on that remote computer as if you were logged into it (because you log into it remotely).
   </p>

  <pre>
    <code>ssh username@hostAddress</code>
  </pre>
  <p>The machines in this lab are all open to be ssh'ed using your STUYCS accounts.</p>
  <p>Marge is <pre>149.89.161.100</pre> please do NOT use marge for general work.</p>
  <p>All other machines are: <pre>149.89.161.1xx</pre> where xx is 01,02,03,... 31,32</p>
  <p>The command <pre>ssh username@149.89.161.100</pre> would try to connect to marge, and ask your for your password for the cs lab.</p>
  <p>From marge, you can <pre>ssh username@149.89.161.115</pre> to connect to <code>cslab4-15</code> </p>


  <h3>Classwork Repo</h3>
  <p>Please clone and use this repo to store your day to day files and a few homework assignments: <a href="https://classroom.github.com/a/B6E-H1jV">https://classroom.github.com/a/B6E-H1jV</a> </p>


    <h3>Scavenger hunt!</h3>

    <p><strong>YOU MUST NOT CLONE THIS IN YOUR HOME DIRECTORY!!!!</strong></p>

    <p>You will use your last 4 digits of your osis as your <strong>random seed</strong> so you do not forget it.</p>
    <p>
      You can continue your scavenger hunt on another machine because you can recreate the scavenger hunt with
      the same <strong>random seed</strong> as last time. You can SSH back into the lab computers, and recreate the hunt if it got deleted.
    </p>


    <p>You will be logging your scavenger hunt so please read the how to submit section!</p>
    <p>To get started:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>
    <pre><code>mkdir /tmp/`whoami`;cd /tmp/`whoami`;git clone https://github.com/pushingice/scavenger-hunt.git</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Now you must read the README carefully and follow directions.</p>
    <p>Use the last4 digits of your osis as your secret number. (random seed)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>If you get lost please use: <pre><code>cd /tmp/`whoami`/scavenger-hunt</code></pre></p>

    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Try the hunt as it is intended, and when you finish it will show you a cool method you could have hacked the hunt from the start! </p>
    <p><strong>Do not look into the python files, or use your python-fu to get your clues</strong> as that completely circumvents the purpose of this activity.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>If "which python" doesn't work as intended, try using "" as the result instead of "no python found" or similar.</p>
    </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Remember you can have more than one terminal open, for example one to display your information, and another to test commands.</p>
    <p>Note that the whoami command prints your username to stdout. The backticks insert the results of that into the terminal command.</p>


    <h3>How to submit:</h3>

    <p>Make a file: <code>01-scavenger.txt</code> in the root of your classwork repo. </p>
    <p>This should be a plain text document no other file types!</p>
    <p>The file should contain: your name, seed, and all 12 of y our clues in the format:</p>

    <pre class="codeblock"><code>Period,Last,First
seed
problem#,LOCATION, explanation how did you get this location
problem#,LOCATION, explanation how did you get this location
...
explanation at the end</code></pre>
    <p>Your hint is exactly what you give to the nextclue command.</p>
    <p>Problem 12 requires an explanation of how you found it.</p>
    <p>After 12, please write an explanation of how easy/hard the hunt was for you, and if you used any alternative ways to find the solution(s)</p>
    <p>e.g.</p>
    <pre class="codeblock"><code>09,Smith,Kenji
0210  #the seed (secret number needed for your quest.)
1,README, Mr.K told me to go here...
2,50240, the command foo gave me the hint fish
3,12394, using ls and combining the results got the hint 123
4,54133, i used the sudo command to pwn all
...(more lines)
12,20042,????
It was hard until I decided to used magic! The magic of the terminal! (not a good response)</code></pre>
    <p>Try your best, and don't worry if you get stuck! Posting on piazza will help you un-stuck yourself.</p>
    <p>There are ways around any commands that don't work due to permissions.</p>

  <h2>Cyber Hygiene</h2>


  <h3>Terminology</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>hacker, attacker, intruder : People who seek to exploit weakness in computer systems for their own gain.</li>
    <li>vulnerability : Flaws in software, firmware, or hardware that can be exploited by anattacker to perform unauthorized operations on a system.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Hacking</h3>
  <p>~1950 MIT students. or 2024 Chinese/Russian government employees?</p>
  <p>
    The original use of the term hacker dates back to 1950-1960s at MIT.
    Students there enjoyed learning about and experimenting with technology.
    A hack was something innovative/ingenious in the arena of computers and technology.
    This positive connotation exists today in expressions like "life hacks"
    "cooking hacks" etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    This has evolved somewhat, and it is sometimes confusing because 'hacker' can
    have a positive or negative connotation: a creative engineering person, versus a cyber attacker, or even both.
  </p>
  <h3>Hacker Classification</h3>
  <p>Hackers can be classified into three different categories:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>White Hat - Ethical Hackers.
      The "good guys" that use their skills to help protect against attacks / find and report vulnerabilities / design secure systems etc.
      They have permission to try to hack into and detect vulnerabilities.
      They act in an open and professional manner to differentiate themselves from malicious hackers.

    </li>
    <li>Black Hat - Malicious Hackers.
      The "bad guys" that use their skills for malicious purposes.
      They can steal money and information or damage systems.
    </li>
    <li>Grey Hat - They do not have permission to gain access to a company's system or products,
      but find exploits with the intent of highlighting the problem. (often seeking a bounty/reward for doing so, not just going after posted bug bounties)
      They do not have malicious intent but their actions may be illegal.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2><p>What is at risk? How can you protect yourself?</p></h2>
  <h3> What are possible losses due to a cyber attack?</h3>

  <p>Let us consider the possible impacts of cyber attacks? Think what can happen if you don't protect digital data and infrastructure...</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Financial</li>
    <li>Resource Unavailability / Misuse</li>
    <li>Data Loss</li>
    <li>Identity Theft</li>
    <li>Loss of Trust/Reputation</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Identity Theft</h3>
  <p>A crime where an attacker uses information that identifies a person for personal gain. </p>

  <p><strong>Data At Risk:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Name, Address, Phone number,</li>
    <li>DOB, SSN</li>
    <li>Credit Card / Bank info</li>
    <li>Driver's License / Passport</li>
  </ul>


  <strong>Effects of Identity Theft:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Loss of money:   Bank / Credit card fraud</li>
    <li>Actual Identity: Government ID or document theft/usage</li>
  </ul>



  <h3>What can an individual do to protect themselves?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Regularly Updating OS and applications</li>
    <li>Strong Passwords</li>
    <li>Antivirus*</li>
    <li>Change default usernames and passwords</li>
    <li>Use MFA (multi factor authentication)</li>
    <li>Backup of important Files</li>
    <li>Using encryption and Digital Signatures</li>
    <li>Firewalls and intrusion detection systems</li>
    <li>Be suspicious of all email. Expected or otherwise</li>
    <li>Not revealing too much personal information on social networks</li>
    <li>Awareness of present world security scenarios and new attacks</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>*Regarding antivirus</h4>
  <p>Sometimes free antivirus isn't worth having. While Avast, AVG, and several other providers
    offer a free tier of protection, they are often filled with advertizemnts for the upgraded
    veresion of protection.</p>
  <p>Microsoft's windows defender is a great free option, but you may want to supplement that with something for your web browsing, or for additional malware detection.</p>



    <h2 id="2025-01-30h">Homework02:</h2>
  <h3>1. Your data</h3>
  <p>Back up all of your STUYCS lab data somewhere else. Your data is not protected and can be erased at any time. </p>
  <p>If you have anything that is not in a github repository, you might want to make one to store your old work (intro etc).</p>
  <p>Any GitHub repositories that you do not OWN (everything on GitHub classrooms), should be forked so you have a copy that you do in fact own, provided you wish to maintain it.</p>

  <h3>2. What you should you be doing now: (if you want to be safe)</h3>
  <p>The following are good practices that you should aim to do/start doing as soon as you can. There is no deadline and I won't check, but they will make you safer overall.</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Update all of your software</li>
  <li>Turn on multi factor authentication for all of your accounts that support it.</li>
  <li>Migrate to a password manager. (Bitwarden or similar, do NOT use LastPass)</li>
  <li>Change all of your (important) passwords to a 16+ character long randomized string using your password manager prioritizing your most important accounts and working your way down the list.</li>
  <li>Install / Update (regularly) a reputable antivirus*</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>2025-01-28</h5>

  <h2>1. Expectations and Prior Knowledge</h2>

  <h3>Language Familiarity</h3>
  <p>All students are expected to be proficient in Java/Processing, and possibly other languages as well.</p>
  <p>While you are not required to know multiple lanugages, it would allow you to pick the best tool for the job on a lab where you are allowed to use any language you choose.</p>
  <p>It is very useful to know python in addition to a more strongly typed language.</p>

  <h3>Termial Familiarity</h3>
  <p>I expect you all have had experience working with a terminal, and working with github. If you avoided using the terminal in the past, you have now run out of time to practice and will required to use it going forward.</p>
  <p>This is a good place to see some of the basic skills you will all need:   <a href="https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview">https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview</a> </p>
  <p>I will go over commands and make them part of future assignments, but doing this now (when you are not swamped with other work) would make your later portions of the class go more smoothly.</p>
  <p>You are expected to be able to use the lab machines (and hopefully your personal devices) to be able to view/edit files and more. In the lab I expect that all students would be able to create a file in a particular directory and paste/edit code fairly quickly. (e.g. Paste some code into <code>Documents/cyber/classwork/2025-01-28/Demo.java</code> ) </p>
  <p></p>

  <h3>Working environment</h3>
  <p>
    Part of this course will be making sure you are able to use a wide variety of tools.
    Even though some tools will be replicated in a web based sandbox, there are
    instances where you will need to demonstrate you can use those tools outside
    of the sandbox (from your personal device).</p>
  <p>Please ensure you have a working linux os on your personal device.</p>
  <p>If you have a mac or linux computer, you already have one!</p>
  <h3>Mac</h3>
  <p>To work on a Mac computer you must install Xcode from the App Store. Run the following in a terminal in install xcode command line tools: <pre>xcode-select --install</code></pre> </p>
  <h3>Windows</h3>
  <p>Windows users can install WSL (a linux virtual machine) on your windows computers:</p>
  <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install</a>

  <h3>Danger! Don't be stupid.</h3>
  <p>Anything you learn in this class can be used legally on your own computers, or with any computers you get permission to use. You must never "test out that cool thing" without permission.</p>
  <p>Crimes involving computers tend to be felonies and the prosecution has a lot of incentive to convict "hackers" regardless of the reasons or the scope of the crime.</p>
  <p>Please think before you act, and ask for permission before you act.</p>

  <h2>2. What is Cybersecurity?</h2>
  <p><strong>Cybersecurity are techniques and practices that are designed to protect digital data and infrastructure. </strong></p>
  <p>There are related security fields</p>
  <p>e.g. information security or even just... security.</p>
  <p>Physically securing your infrastructure is needed to protect digital things but that is beyond the scope of cybersecurity.</p>

  <h3>Why care about learning Cybersecurity?</h3>
  <p>Before going into the "what" question, let us touch upon the in-demand nature of the field.</p>
  <p>If you enjoy things in this class there are more jobs than qualified people to take them. They are well paying jobs.</p>

  <p><strong>Basically:</strong> They are paying you to play with computers!<sup>*</sup></p>
  <p>
    <strong>*</strong>if playing with computers means being passionate about learning about a highly technical
    field and wanting to use this knowledge to do good!
  </p>

  <h3>What does Cybersecurity include?</h3>
  <p>There are many categories within cybersecurity:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Application security   </strong> - programs including operating system</li>
    <li><strong>Network and infrastructure security</strong> - including web/cloud systems</li>
    <li><strong>Intrusion detection</strong></li>
    <li><strong>penetration testing</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Digital forensics and incident response</strong> - After the fact, figure out what happened, limit damage, and prevent future incidents</li>
    <li><strong>Endpoint protection and mobile security</strong> - protecting end-user devices such as desktops, laptops, and mobile devices</li>
    <li><strong>Data governance, risk and compliance</strong> - practices to comply with government or industry rules/regulations.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These are very broad categories, <strong>penetration testing </strong> for example can be broken down further:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Physical Pen Testing</strong> - Measure the effectiveness of security procedures, training, and controls by attempting physical access to an organization.</li>
    <li><strong>External Pen Testing</strong> - Find vulnerabilities that can be exploited by external attackers to access infrastructure or data.</li>
    <li><strong>Internal Pen Testing</strong> - Determining the possible impact of an attacker getting different kinds of credientials, and the level of access required to overcome the security.</li>
    <li><strong>Web App Pen Testing</strong> -  Find technical flaws or vulnerabilities in the web aplications run by an organization</li>
    <li><strong>PCI Pen Testing</strong> - (Payment Card Industry) Validating security of credit card information.  </li>
    <li><strong>Red Teaming</strong> - Simulation of a real attack using the same tactics that attacker's would employ. This is a more holistic test.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This is not mentioning the myriad of tools and techniques required. Some of which such as Cryptography are huge topics that you can study for years.</p>
