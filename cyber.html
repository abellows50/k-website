<h5> 2025-02-27</h5>
<p>
  The vigenere cipher is a Polyalphabetic cipher that uses 26 different substitution ciphers.
  A string of text key is used to determine which cipher to use.
  The keyword is looped when the message is shorter than the key.
  The below is used for this cipher and is called a tabula recta,
  it is a 26 by 26 grid where each row is shifted one additional time.
</p>
<img loading="lazy" src="img/tabularecta.jpg" width="500px">
<p>Let us pick a key to use and a plaintext to encrypt. You repeat the key to fit the length of the plaintext.</p>
<p>Plaintext: asimpleexample</p>
<p>Key: battista</p>
<code>
  asimpleexample</br>
  battistabattis</br>
</code>
<p>Align the key with the plaint text. For every pair of letters, the top row of the table is for the key letter, the left column labels are for the plaintext. The location of the intersection is the ciphertext.</p>
<h4>First letter pair</h4>
<p><strong>a</strong>simpleexample</p>
<p><strong>b</strong>attistabattis</p>
<img loading="lazy" src="img/vigenereFirstLetter.jpg">
<h4>Second letter pair</h4>
<p>a<strong>s</strong>impleexample</p>
<p>b<strong>a</strong>ttistabattis</p>
<img loading="lazy" src="img/vigenereSecondLetter.jpg">
<h4>Third letter pair</h4>
<p>as<strong>i</strong>mpleexample</p>
<p>ba<strong>t</strong>tistabattis</p>
<img loading="lazy" src="img/vigenereThirdLetter.jpg">

<h4>Finish Encoding the example above!</h4>
<code>asimpleexample (plaintext)</br>
  battistabattis (keytext)</br>
  BSB??????????? (ciphertext)
</code>

<h4>Decoding</h4>
<p>Decoding the ciphertext requires that you know the key, and you align it with the ciphertext!</p>
<code>
  battistabattis (keytext)</br>
  BSB??????????? (ciphertext)
</code>

<h4>First letter pair to decode</h4>
<p><strong>b</strong>attistabattis</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>SB?????</p>
<p>
  Use column b, and find the B in that column. Move to the leftmost letter that aligns with that B... which is the A.
</p>
<img loading="lazy" src="img/vigenereFirstLetter.jpg">

<h3>The message fully encoded is:</h3>

<h5>BSBFXDXEYAFITW</h5>

<h2>Try to Decode:</h2>
<pre>Ciphertext: LBTQRJCDFIGNWIIK
Key:        SUPERSUPERSUPERS</pre>

<h4>Why is this better?</h4>
<p>Look at this plaintext:</p>
<code>Aged twenty six, Vigenere was sent to Rome on a diplomatic mission. It was here that he became acquainted with the writings of Alberti, Trithemius and Porta, and his interest in cryptography was ignited. For many years, cryptography was nothing more than a tool that helped him his diplomatic work, but at the age of thirty nine, Vigènere decided that he had amassed enough money to be able to abandon his career and concentrate on a life of study. It was only then that he began research into a new cipher.</code>

<p>Now let us look at two ciphertexts.</p>
<p> The first one is encrypted with a monoalphabetic cipher:</p>
<code>ETYR QVYIQX OBW, UBTYIYMY VEO OYIQ QJ MJHY JI E RBKGJHEQBC HBOOBJI. BQ VEO AYMY QAEQ AY NYCEHY ECLSEBIQYR VBQA QAY VMBQBITO JP EGNYMQB, QMBQAYHBSO EIR KJMQE, EIR ABO BIQYMYOQ BI CMXKQJTMEKAX VEO BTIBQYR.

BQ VEO JIGX QAYI QAEQ AY NYTEI MYOYEMCA BIQJ E IYV CBKAYM.</code>
<p>The second is encrypted with a vigenere cipher</p>
<code>ETGU RLXRGA JGM, OMTGECGX ANU JCCM XB TFKT HR N FZNAHQNVZA BBWFKFL.

<h3>Shortcomings of Vigenere cypher</h3>
<p>
  An attacker that knows the length of the key (or calculates it based on the distance between matching ciphertext)
  they can then break the cipher by analyzing subsets of letters.
  If the key length is 3, then you can make three groups of letters,
  and those groups will all have the same frequency patterns as normal text.</p>

<h4>Repetitions in Ciphertext are a weakness:</h4>

<p>It is not difficult to find the length of the key when keys are sufficiently short.
  Searching for blocks of ciphertext that look the same we can assume they are the same plaintext
  (for sufficiently large blocks of matching text, clearly not every pair of matching letters is the same plaintext.)
</p>

<p>This is because repetition in the plaintext, could align with the same letters of the key:</p>

<h4>Example:</h4>

<code>
  "saysyoussaysmessaysitsnow" (plaintext)</br>
  "paperpaperpaperpaperpaper" (key)
</code>
<p>Two of the words "say" ("<strong>say</strong>syoussaysmes<strong>say</strong>sitsnow") align with "pap" thus they will have the same ciphertext </p>

<h3>Lets look at how we can find the keylength</h3>

<pre>
  VHVSSPQUCEMRVBVBBBVHVSURQGIBDUGRNICJQUCERVUAXSSR
  ^     ^           ^                 ^
  0     6           18                36
</pre>
<p>The distance between the repetitions of VHVS is 18.</p>
<p>The key length could be 18, 9, 6, 3, 2 or 1 character long.</p>
<p>The distance between the repetitions of QUCE is 30 characters.</p>
<p>The key length could be 30, 15, 10, 6, 5, 3, 2 or 1 character long.</p>
<p>By taking the intersection of those sets, one could safely conclude that the most likely key length is 6 since 3, 2, and 1 are unrealistically short.</p>



<h4>Use longer keys!</h4>

<p>Frequency analysis fails when the key is a large fraction of the message, certainly when the key is equal in length to the message.</p>

<h3>Computers can do it too!</h3>
<p>On paper a lookup table is faster for humans.</p>
<p>Think about how a computer program could be implemented.
  In effect, the index of each row in the table tells you
  how many characters to shift each letter of the plaintext by.
  <br>Row (A) is 0, so there is no rotation,
  <br>row (B) is 1, so you rotate left by 1.
  <br>row (C) is 2, so you rotate left by 2,etc.
</p>

</p>

<ol>
  <li>(MANUALLY) Find repeating groups of letters. (This is not a code exercise! Search by eye for repeated strings, or use control-F (search))</li>
  <li>(MANUALLY) Calculate the distance between the matching strings. This takes 2 seconds using a programming language e.g. <pre> <code>$python
  >>> len("asdlfkjalfjaslfjaslfjaslfjkasflj")
  34
  >>></code></pre> or
  <p><code>$echo -n "asdlfkjalfjaslfjaslfjaslfjkasflj" | wc</code></p> <li>
  <p>Note, echo adds a "\n" to the end of your text, so the <code>-n</code> flag will prevent that. </p>

<li>(MANUALLY) Try to find the key length by finding the overlapping common factors of the distances. (do this manually)</li>
<li>(PROGRAM) Assuming you have the correct key-length, break the text into key-length different piles  (use a programming language, but python slices work well.)</li>
<li>(PROGRAM) Run your ceasar cracker from your 1st lab to get decoded strings.</li>
<li>(PROGRAM) Merge the decoded strings back together (use a programming language)</li>
</ol>

<h3>String concatenation is slow...</h3>
<p>For large data sets, you do NOT want to use a bunch of string concatenation operations in java or python. (Since strings are mutable in c, you just need a large enough buffer.)</p>
<pre><code>public class StringBuilderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        //slow way commented out
        //String s =  "";
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
            sb.append("Number: ").append(i).append("\n");
            //s += "Number: ";
            //s += i + ;
            //s += "\n";
        }
        String result = sb.toString();//faster than calculating s
    }
}</code></pre>

<pre><code>string_list = []
#s=""
for i in range(1000000):
        string_list.append("Number: ")
        string_list.append(str(i))
        string_list.append("\n")
        #s+="Number: ";
        #s+=str(i)

  <h3>Classwork</h3>
  <p>Use Terminal Commands to sort your frequencies from high to low, and only look at the top 5.</p>

  <h3>Examples that should work:</h3>
  <p>Print the frequencies of A-E</p>
  <pre>make frequency ARGS="alice.txt" | head -n 5</pre>
  <p>Print the frequencies of W-Z</p>
  <pre>make frequency ARGS="alice.txt" | tail -n 5</pre>


  <h3>Polyalphabetic ciphers</h3>

  <p>
    Multiple monoalphabetic ciphers are used to encrypt
    There are rules to determine when to use each one.
    The result of this is that two letters that are the same in the ciphertext do not have to be the same in plaintext.
  </p>

  <h4>Simple example: </h4>
  <p>Even positioned letters shift up by one. Odd positioned letters shift down by one.</p>
  <p>Plaintext:</p>
  <code>m<strong>e</strong><strong>e</strong>t m<strong>e</strong> <strong>a</strong>t the hot dog st<strong>a</strong>nd</code>
  <p>Ciphertext:</p>
  <code>n<strong>df</strong>s n<strong>d</strong> <strong>b</strong>s ugf gps enh ru<strong>z</strong>oc</code>

  <p>In this cipher:</p>
  <p> <strong>a</strong> can be either <strong>b</strong> or <strong>z</strong></p>
  <p> <strong>e</strong> can be either <strong>d</strong> or <strong>f</strong></p>

  <h3>Playfair Cipher:</h3>
  <p>This uses a 5x5 table of letters which acts as the key. This means one letter must be omitted, often the I and J are combined, or Q is left out.</p>

  <pre>Example:
    P L A Y F
    I R E X M
    B C D G H
    K N O Q S
    T U V W Z
  </pre>

  <p>The word is then broken up into groups of two letters, and then those pairs are converted into ciphertext using the table.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>If the letters are on the same column, use the letters to their right to replace them. (this can be a variable in the encryption methodology)</li>
    <li>If the letters are on the same row, use the letters below them to replace them. (this can be a variable in the encryption methodology)</li>
    <li>If the letters are different, replace them with the letters on the same row, but in the column of the other letter (it would make a rectangle)</li>
    <li>If the letters are the same, replace the 2nd one with an X (or Q if you removed X) and then encrypt using the prior rules. (The least frequent letter is used for this to make it obvious when decrypting as double letters are much more common than X.)</li>
  </ol>


  <p>Let us use this to encrypt a short message:</p>

  <pre>Whitehat</pre>

  <p>Look at pairs of letters:</p>

  <pre>WH IT EH AT</pre>

  <p>
    Imagine the 2 plaintext letters WH are opposite corners of a rectangle,
    that pair of letters will be substituted with the letters in the other
    opposite corners </p>

  <pre>
    P L A Y F
    I R E X M
    B C D G H
    K N O Q S
    T U V W Z
  </pre>

  <p>WH becomes ZG </p>
  <p>IT becomes RU (vertical letters use the ones to the right)</p>
  <p>EH becomes MD</p>
  <p>AT becomes PV</p>

  <p>Result: </p>
  <p>ZGRUMDPV</p>

  <p>Decrypt using the opposite operations. First break up the ciphertext in to pairs: ZG RU MD PV, then run the same rules, except vertical goes left /horizontal goes up.</p>


  <h3>Try to decode:</h3>
  <p>Encode : Same row letters use cell on the right. </p>
  <p>Encode : Same column uses cell below.</p>

  <p>"SIHTHTELMBVIDFSBKOKCWYCZSY"</p>
  <p>using the key: "ABCDEFGHIKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ" (no 'J')</p>
  <p>Decode : Same row letters use cell on the left. </p>
  <p>Decode : Same column uses cell above.</p>

  <h3>Frequency:</h3>
  <p>This is plaintext:</p>
  <p> Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice “without pictures or conversations?”

So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.

There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge. </p>

  <h3>Other Polyalphabetic Ciphers</h3>
  <p>Basic understanding: What does having multiple alphabetic substitutions do to prevent the code from being broken?</p>
  <p>Creative: How could we design a more secure Polyalphabetic cipher?</p>
  <p>Fun fact: encode and decode are not symmetric operations, but encode ten times is the same as not applying any changes. How can we use this property to "decode" using encode.</p>

  A <strong>monoalphabetic cipher</strong> is one where each symbol in plain text is mapped to a fixed symbol in cipher text.
  The substitution not depend on the position of the plain text character, there is just
  a one to one mapping based on a single alphabetic key.
</p>

<p>There are many different monoalphabetic substitution ciphers.</p>
<p>
  Each letter can be encrypted to any symbol, not just another letter. (See pigpen cipher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigpen_cipher">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigpen_cipher</a> )
</p>

<h3>Shift ciphers</h3>
<p>  The Caesar cipher is a well known cipher where each letter is shifted based on a numeric key</p>
<p>Rot13 is a Caesar cipher where the key is 13.</p>

<h3>Atbash</h3>
<p>The atbash cipher (also called mirror cipher or backwards alphabet or reverse alphabet) is a cipher where you reverse the order of the letters. e.g. change A to Z, B to Y, and so on. </p>


<h3>Simple Substitution</h3>
<p>
  Since a shifted alphabet only has 26 possible rotations
  (or double that if you include reversing the order),
  that can be cracked instantly by trying all 26 keys.</p>
<p>Instead we use more randomized arrangments. There are <code>26!</code> different substitution arrangements so that is much better for preventing someone from just printing 26 variations of the text and seeing which can be read.</p>
<p>That is: you can map the original alphabet to any permutation of the alphabet and use that as a key to encrypt/decrypt.</p>

<h3>Variant keys</h3>
<p>Rather than a full alphabet mapping as a key You can use a single word as a key (Move those letters to the front of the list):</p>
<p>Plaintext alphabet  <pre>ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ</pre></p>
<p>Ciphertext alphabet <pre>ZEBRASCDFGHIJKLMNOPQTUVWXY</pre></p>

<h3>Writing out ciphertext</h3>
<p>Usually the ciphertext is written out in blocks of fixed length, omitting punctuation and spaces to disguise word boundaries from the plaintext.</p>
<p>It is easy to figure out substitutions when you see word boundaries because there are very few 2-3 letter words to test with trial and error.</p>
<p>Plaintext: "we are discovered!"</p>
<p>Ciphertext: "VA ZOA RFPBLUAOAR!"</p>
<p>To make it more difficult we alter the format:</p>
<p>Ciphertext  in groups of 5 letters <pre>VAZOA RFPBL UAOAR</pre></p>


<h1 id="2025-02-13h">Lab01 - Monoalphabetic ciphers</h1>
<p>Deadline Wed Feb 26 8am</p>
<h3>Makefile requirements</h3>
<p>There is no <code> make compile</code> , your dependencies must be correct. Suppress your commands with <code>@</code> in the makefile.</p>

<h3>Part  1.1</h3>
<p>Write a program that when given source text filename, analyzes letter frequency contained in that file.</p>
<p>
  Letter frequency should ignore case (both lower and uppercase are counted in the same category/bucket)
  Punctuation/special characters are completely discarded from the calculations.
  The denominator of the frequency should be the total number of letters counted.</p>
<p>Assume the text uses the English alphabet to simplify our programs.</p>
<p>Print out each letter and the frequency in the format:</p>
<pre>
A 0.04521
B 0.00231
C 0.00134
D 0.00024
...
X 0.0
Y 0.00051
Z 0.0003
</pre>
<h4>Implementation requirement:</h4>
<p>
  You must have a function that returns a list/array of the 26 frequencies in order, to make the next part easier.
</p>
<p>e.g. <code>freq("alice.txt")</code> returns [0.044521, 0.00231, ...]</p>

<h3>Test your frequency program</h3>

<p>Try using it on alice in wonderland: <a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/phillipj/4944029/raw/75ba2243dd5ec2875f629bf5d79f6c1e4b5a8b46/alice_in_wonderland.txt">https://gist.githubusercontent.com/phillipj/4944029/raw/75ba2243dd5ec2875f629bf5d79f6c1e4b5a8b46/alice_in_wonderland.txt</a>  </p>
<p>You should see percentages like:</p>
<img loading="lazy" src="img/frequencyUnsorted.png" width="400px" alt="alice in wonderland frequencies">
<img loading="lazy" src="img/frequencySorted.png" width="400px" alt="alice in wonderland frequencies">

<h3>STOP! Check your 1.1</h3>
<p>Your lab01 part 1.1 should work like this:</p>
<pre>$make frequency ARGS="inputFileName"</pre>
<p>e.g.</p>
<pre>$make frequency ARGS="alice.txt"</pre>
<p>This enables a standard interface no matter what langage you use</p>

<h3>Part 1.2</h3>
<p>Write a program that when given two filenames, calculate the distance between two different sets of letter frequencies of each file.</p>
<h4>Example 1 (3d point)</h4>
<img loading="lazy" src="img/DistanceNDimensions.jpg" width="600px">
<p>For the example below, we will pretend we only have letters, a,b,c,d.</p>
<h4>Example 2 (4d point)</h4>
<p>Given text1 has frequencies [0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2] and text2 has frequencies [0.2, 0.25, 0.06, 0.29]</p>
<p>The distance is  sqrt ( (.2 - .2) <sup>2</sup> + (.2 - .25) <sup>2</sup> + (.2 - .06) <sup>2</sup> +  (.2 - .29) <sup>2</sup> )  </p>
<p>The result of which is sqrt(0.0302), so the distance is: 0.173781</p>
<h4>Important things to make sure of:</h4>
<p>Your code should work with arrays of EQUAL size. In the case of our program, size = 26.</p>

<p><strong>Urgent:</strong> your program should open files HOWEVER, you should not have a distance function take in filenames! </p>
<p>Your distance function should take the array of frequencies. <strong>This is critical</strong> as it allows you to read the file once, and re-use the resulting frequency table in multiple distance calculations.</p>
<p>e.g.</p>
<p> <code>dist([0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.0],[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.0])</code> returns 0.0</p>

<p><strong>Do not do this: </strong> <code> dist("filename1","filename2")</code>   <strong>Do not do this!</strong></p>

<h3>STOP! Check your 1.2</h3>
<p>Your lab01 part 1.2 should work like this:</p>
<pre>$make distance ARGS="inputFileName1 inputFileName2"</pre>
<p>e.g.</p>
<pre>$make distance ARGS="alice.txt other.txt"</pre>

<h3>Part 1.3</h3>
<p>Write a program that when given a ciphertext filename, that contains a Caesar ciphered text analyzes letter frequency contained in that file, and deocdes the message automatically. Printing a single decodede message.</p>
<p>You should ALSO include reversed alphabet and reverse shifted alphabets.</p>
<p>This will work with sufficiently long ciphertexts, but short messages may not work well.</p>

<h4>How to do this:</h4>
<p>Your methodology should be to:  .</p>
<p>Calculate the english_frequency by using <code>alice.txt</code> once.</p>
<p>Calculate the message_frequency of the message once.</p>
<p>Now find the rotation_number of the message_frequency that is closest to English using your distance function.</p>
<p>Rotate your message (try forward or back) by that rotation_number and you should have your decoded message.</p>
<p>To make this work with reversed alphabet ciphers (e.g. a and z are swapped, b and y are swapped.. etc.) you have to try to do the process twice, and see if swapped letters make a smaller minimum distance.</p>

<strong>Note:</strong>
<p>Punctuation and spaces are ignored for your frequency calculations, but are kept when decoding.</p>

<h3>STOP! Check your 1.3</h3>
<p>Your lab01 part 1.3 should work like this:</p>
<pre>$make decode ARGS="inputFileName"</pre>


<p>e.g.</p>
<pre>$make decode ARGS="message.txt"</pre>
<p>output:</p>
<pre>DECODED_MESSAGE_HERE</pre>

<h3>Sample messages to try to decode:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Znoy skznuj corr sujole znk gxxge gtj tuz xkzaxt gteznotm. </li>
  <li>Drp Kyv Wfitv Sv Nzky Pfl</li>
  <li>Ftueuemomqemdoubtqdfqjf</li>
  <li>Zlka zovz ka boxobaop sfp zlof alknzop ru 7 qlsbsqzoba. Zlsz ka aydob aoqybo erxkeyahu.</li>
  <li>Jmqi rhybbyw, qdt jxu ibyjxo jelui. Tyt wohu qdt wycrbu yd jxu mqru: Qbb cycio muhu jxu rehewelui, Qdt jxu cecu hqjxi ekjwhqru.</li>
</ol>
<p>The last one should be: "Twas brillig, and the slithy toves. Did gyre and gimble in the wabe: All mimsy were the borogoves, And the mome raths outgrabe."</p>

<p>Not all messages will auto decode correctly depending on the text length and letters.</p>
<p>e.g. "jg upnro xo dla otqgpo" would NOT auto decode to: "ur faycz iz owl zebraz" </p>

 <h3>Homework:</h3>
 <p> Perusall on Stuxnet Due tomorrow</p>

  <h3>Addendum to hashing</h3>
  <p>Consider the output is modded by 1 billion, but there are more than 1 billion paswords. What are the consequences?</p>
  <p>
    Since the output size is smaller than the input size there are some inputs that map to the same output, which is called a collision.
    It is very unlikely to guess a password with the same hash however, and as long as the collisions are spread evenly (not grouped together) then this is not an issue.
  </p>

  <h2>Cryptography</h2>

  <p> <strong>Plain Text / Clear Text</strong> - Unencrypted, human-readable text. This is the data you wan to encrypt.</p>

  <p><strong>Cipher</strong> - The algorithm used to encrypt data.</p>

  <p><strong>Cipher Text</strong> - The encrypted text formatted by an encryption algorithm that is no longer human-readable.</p>

  <p><strong>Encryption Key</strong> - The second piece of information used by the encryption algorithm to encrypt and potentially decrypt the data later.</p>
  <h3>Properties of good cryptographic functions:</h3>

  <p>Keep the following properties in mind when looking at the different methods of encryption. These characteristics prevent patterns from being used to analyze the ciphertext.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cipher text should appear completely random.</li>
    <li>Cipher text should not be related to the plain text or it's distribution of characters.</li>
    <li>Cipher text should not be related to the key or its characters.</li>
    <li>Small changes in the key should completely change the cipher text.</li>
    <li>Small changes in the plain text should completely change the cipher text.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Encryption:</h3>
  <p>Encryption is a form of data security.</p>
  <p>Encryption is the process of converting readable data into a format that is not understood by any unauthorized person.</p>
  <p>Decrypting the file requires access to a key/password.</p>
  <p>The purpose of encryption is protecting sensitive information when being transmitted or stored.</p>

  <h5> 2025-02-11</h5>
  <h2>Do Now</h2>
  <p>Consider dates in the format YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY/MM/DD, how do you match that using regex? (assume starting from the year 1000)</p>
  <p>What if the year can be 2 or 4 digits. YY-MM-DD ? What if the MM and DD can be 1 digit, e.g. 4 instaed of 04</p>
  <p>Now what about validation of realistic already existing dates (19xx or 20xx) / also valid month/days: 00-99-99 is not valid.</p>
  <p>Do not worry about matching correct number of days in the month.</p>
  <p style="display:none"><code>^(19|20)?[0-9]{2}(\/|-)(1[0-2]|0?[1-9])\2(3[01]|[12][0-9]|0?[1-9])$</code></p>

  <h3>quick topic:</h3>
  <p>Browsers have inspect html or edit html features</p>

  <h3>Change Passwords</h3>
  <p>A minor detour from applied terminal skills:</p>
  <p>Everyone needs to ssh onto the password server and change their password.</p>
  <p>Instructions provided in class.</p>
  <p style="display:none">Go to the password server, <code>ssh username@149.89.17.91</code> , then change your password using the command:  <code>passwd</code> </p>

  <h3>Quiz</h3>
  <p>You have a quiz on Feb 12th xor Feb 13th on regex + terminal commands / shell features (including pipes redirects etc).</p>

  <h3>Terminal</h3>
  <p>Minor point: <code>cd</code> and <code>exit</code> are not programs, they are built into the shell. This is different from ls, wc, cowsay, cp, mv, etc, are all programs.</p>
  <p>Similarly <code>&lt</code> , <code>&gt</code> , <code>|</code> are also built into the shell.</p>
  <p>The <code>&</code> and <code>fg</code> options are super useful built in shell features as well. Combined with <code>Ctrl-Z</code> you can run/send commands to the background of your shell while you do other things!</p>


  <h3>Operations security</h3>
  <p>
    Operations security (OPSEC) is a process that identifies critical information to determine
    if friendly actions can be observed by enemy intelligence, determines if information obtained
    by adversaries could be interpreted to be useful to them, and then executes selected measures
    that eliminate or exploitation of friendly critical information. - Wiki definition
  </p>

  <h3>General Skill Stacks:</h3>
  <p>
    There are many different very deep categories of knowledge in cybersecurity.
    It can take years to master just one of these. Each of these stacks can be  broken down into many components…
    Many of these fields do not require you to be the best at math, or coding!

  <h3>Passwords:</h3>
  <p>Let us see why you need to include capital letters, numbers, and special characters in your passwords:</p>
  <p><img loading="lazy" src="img/passwords.png" width="700px" alt="password possibilities chart"></p>
  <p>The actual impact of special characters is even greater, as this chart excludes many acceptable characters such as <code>-+{}[]&lt&gt|\/</code> </p>
  <p>
    Let us use the shorthand for a type of password which contains many different symbols regardless of length, we will use the term "good password" to mean this.
    "good passwords" use Numbers, Upper+Lower case letters, AND symbols... That is about 80 possibilities on the keyboard per character.
    The number of passwords is therefore  is 80<sup>x</sup> where x = password length.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>80<sup>1</sup> = 80</li>
    <li>80<sup>2</sup> = 6400</li>
    <li>80<sup>3</sup> = 512,000</li>
    <li>80<sup>4</sup> = 40,960,000</li>
    <li>80<sup>5</sup> = 3,276,800,000</li>
    <li>80<sup>6</sup> = 262,144,000,000</li>
    <li>80<sup>7</sup> = 20,971,520,000,000</li>
    <li>80<sup>8</sup> = 1,677,721,600,000,000</li>
    <li>80<sup>9</sup> = 134,217,728,000,000,000</li>
  </ol>
  <p>etc...</p>


    <p>Here is a good measure to see how cheap cracking is available to all: <a href="https://thesecurityfactory.be/password-cracking-speed/">https://thesecurityfactory.be/password-cracking-speed/</a> </p>

    <h3>Passwords are hashed</h3>
    <p>In order to have your services not store your password,they store a hashed password. This is a one way encryption function.</p>
    <p>When you submit your password, the service will hash what you submitted and check if that matches the hash that was stored, you typed your password correctly.</p>

    <h3>What are hashes?</h3>
    <p>A hash function is often called a trap door function. Computing the result is easy, computing the inverse of the operation is not possible. A function with no inverse that is used in hashing is the remainder operation.</p>
    <p>example: Imagine adding up the ASCII values of a string and modding by some value. You could not undo this operation to get the string.</p>
    <p>The example is a very poor hashing algorithm, but it illustrates that it is not difficult to come up with a trap door function.</p>

    <h3>Cracking Passwords:</h3>
    <p>Passwords are not cracked by guessing on the website login page, that is almost never the way you brute force a password.</p>
    <p>In practice, websites can have their user data stolen, which includes a list of their users, their email addresses, and their encrypted passwords. There can be much more information stolen depending on the service that was hacked.</p>
    <p>Since the passwords are encrypted and you cannot calculate the inverse of the hash you are safe... right?</p>
    <p>Wrong.</p>

    <h3>Cracking Hashes:</h3>
    <h4>Brute Force Attacks</h4>
    <p>The way you crack a hash is: use the same hashing algorithm on all possible words until the results match the hash of the password you are trying to find.</p>
    <p>In the table below, if you have the hash <code>84d961568a65073a3bcf0eb216b2a576</code> you just have to start hashing all words... "password" "letmein" "superman" etc. until the result matches your hash</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>attempt</th><th>result</th>
      </tr>
        <tr><td>hash("a")</td><td>0cc175b9c0f1b6a831c399e269772661</td></tr>
        <tr><td>hash("b")</td><td>92eb5ffee6ae2fec3ad71c777531578f</td></tr>
        <tr><td>...</td></tr>
        <tr><td>hash("ab")</td><td>187ef4436122d1cc2f40dc2b92f0eba0</td></tr>
        <tr><td>...</td></tr>
        <tr><td>hash("letmein")</td><td>0d107d09f5bbe40cade3de5c71e9e9b7</td></tr>
        <tr><td>...</td></tr>
        <tr><td>hash("password")</td><td>5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99</td></tr>
        <tr><td>...</td></tr>
        <tr><td>hash("superman")</td><td> <strong>84d961568a65073a3bcf0eb216b2a576</strong> </td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>Upon hashing superman, you can see that the resulting hash is the same as the original one we were looking for. The password is superman.</p>



    <h3>Fast computers can crack hashes VERY fast</h3>
    <p>
      Let us consider that a highly specialized computer or computer cluster can calculate billions of hashes per second.
      This means that a length 6 "good" password would take seconds to find the right hash, while a length 7 password would take minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is an arbitrary table that chooses an "old" fast way to crack passwords, newer ways are about 5-10 times faster.
      Notice that "1000 times faster! or 1 million times faster" would not help with passwords that are 15+ characters long.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you can see from the image below: If everyone used randomized "good passwords" that were 15+ characters long,
      then cracking hashes would be impossible with current algorithms and hardware.
    </p>

    <h3>Password cracking strategies</h3>
    <p><a href="https://xkcd.com/538/">https://xkcd.com/538/</a></p>
    <img loading="lazy" src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/security.png" alt="https://xkcd.com/538">
    <h4>Step 1: Password list</h4>
    <p>If you have a password list, you can try all of the common passwords first. This will weed out any weak passwords right away.</p>
    <p>
      There is a list of real world passwords called rockyou. This list "rockyou.txt" contains 14,341,564 unique passwords,
      used in millions of different accounts. By pulling real world used passwords you can quickly check these particular
      passwords before you try to crack all the random ones. This has a high chance of succeeding on people that don't use good passwords!
    </p>
    <p>rockyou.txt contains the most frequently used passwords sorted by frequency.</p>

    <p>Keep in mind that rockyou is not really effective against targets with good password policies. To succeed with a dictionary attack you may need to create your own wordlist especially if your target is not in an english speaking country.</p>
    <p>Hackers often supplement this password list with other password lists that contain multiple word combinations and common letter substitutions.</p>
    <p>You can easily aquire this list by googling: "rockyou password list" or "rockyou password list github"</p>
    <p>You can also find rockyou.txt in your cyber_resources directory so you DO NOT download it onto the school network.</p>
    <p>here is a link to the list: <a href="https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt">https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt</a> </p>

    <h4>Step 2: Rainbow tables</h4>
    <p>You can pre-compute all possible hashes for passwords up to a particular length. These precomputed list of passwords+hashes are called rainbow tables.</p>

    <h4>Step 3: brute force cracking</h4>
    <p>This can be dumb try all passwords brute forcing, or more intelligent ones.</p>
    <p>Creative ways include combining multiple words into longer passwords, or patterns e.g. capitalized 1st letter, + 1 number at the end of the password.</p>
    <h3>Protection against Password cracking</h3>
    <h4>Salt</h4>
    <p>To protect against password cracking attempts using rainbow tables, you can use a salt.</p>
    <p>A salt is a random string of characters that is unique per user, and stored with the user information.</p>
    <p>This has several benefits:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Users with the same password will have different hashes. So they must be cracked separately. This multiplies the cracking time by the number of hashshes stolen.</li>
      <li>Rainbow tables most likely will not include significantly longer passwords (The salt length adds to the password length)</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Pepper</h4>
    <p>To protect against password cracking attempts using brute force cracking we use a pepper.</p>
    <p>When you add a random letter to the end of the password before hasing, this is called a pepper.</p>
    <p>A pepper is NOT stored with the account, instead you have to try all possible pepper values. </p>
    <p>This is trivial to test 26 or 52 letters when someone logs in, but imagine cracking and having to test 52 extra times per login.</p>
    <p>This doesn't protect against rainbow tables as it is just one extra letter in length.</p>

    <h4>Putting it together:</h4>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>
          username
        </th>
        <th>
          password
        </th>
        <th>
          salt
        </th>
        <th>
          pepper
        </th>
        <th>
          hash(pass + salt + pepper)
        </th>
        <th>
          resulting hash
        </th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>joe</td>
        <td>"Password"</td>
        <td>"aj3oD"</td>
        <td>?</td>
        <td>hash("Passwordaj3oD"+?)</td>
        <td>f60e0e65d61f713ca1e1840aa096942c</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>dave</td>
        <td>"Password"</td>
        <td>"f03AL"</td>
        <td>?</td>
        <td>hash("Passwordf03AL"+?)</td>
        <td>77e0e8bfdb1b0a0ebf9f0beafb81a5c4</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>joy</td>
        <td>"Mxk4^d(l52Z"</td>
        <td>"gns9R"</td>
        <td>?</td>
        <td>hash("Mxk4^d(l52Zgns9R"+?)</td>
        <td>5a149d3f82c6f4ee24e62ab7f351a3b3</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>You can guess the pepper in these examples by running a command on the string + [a-zA-Z] and checking if any match</p>
    <p><code>echo -n "password" | md5sum</code> </p>
    <p>Note the -n is a flag that removes the newline from the output of echo, so you don't include that in your hash function (md5)</p>

    <h3>Final thoughts</h3>
    <p>Do not implement your own password system. Use existing proven ones. </p>
    <p>e.g. Using Google's <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2">OAuth 2.0 protocol</a>  for authentication and authorization. This lets you piggy back your service on top of googles already secure authentication process and you don't have to store any passwords.</p>

    <h5>2025-02-07</h5>
  <h3>Is your regex weaksauce?</h3>
  <p><strong>Protips:</strong></p>
  <p>Use <a href="regex101.com/">regex101.com</a> to help you figure out why some lines do not get matched!</p>

  <h3>Back to your ssh logs:</h3>
  <p>Here is how you get rid of everything before andincluding the "Disconnected from" in EACH LINE of the text file:</p>
  <p><code>cat sshlogfile | sed 's/^.*Disconnected from //'</code> </p>

  <h3>sed substitutions:</h3>
  <p><code>sed 's/a/b/'</code>  will replace a with b. To use regex add the -E flag.</p>

  <h3>multiple substitutions:</h3>
  <p><code>sed 's/a/b/; s/c/d'</code>  will replace a with b, and also repalce c with d. You can chain multiple substitutions like the following:</p>
  <p><code>cat sshlogfile| sed -E 's/^.*Disconnected from //;s/ port .*$//; s/invalid user //;s/authenticating user //'</code> </p>
  <p>The previous line will remove the start and ending parts of the line, and result in just "username IPADDRESS"</p>

  <h3>Classwork:</h3>
  <p>I have placed <code>/tmp/sshlog.txt</code> on marge for you to retrieve. What commands can get the file?</p>
  <p>Get this file if you don't have it. You can use many commands, scp being the most obvious. I will frequently ask you to get files, you need this skill.</p>
  <p>Create a directory in your classwork repo: <code>repo/2025-02-07-Regex/</code>, place the sshlog.txt in it, and do today's work there. You can create additional files without cluttering your home directory.</p>

  <h4>Filter the failed passwords</h4>
  <p>First we want to find any bad login attempts from invalid passwords. This can be done by grepping the error message that occurs when you give a bad password, find this in the log file then filter your data set.</p>
  <p>You can output that into a 2nd file <code>sshfailed.txt</code> </p>

  <h4>Now lets get the username and IP addresses.</h4>
  <p>Now try to make the regex that matches the whole line but includes CAPTURE GROUPS for the username and the IP address</p>
  <p>The end result should be each line is replaced with "IP username" </p>
  <code>tail sshfailed.txt | sed -E 's/REGEX/REPLACEMENT/'</code>

  <h3>Use capture Groups:</h3>
  <p>Writing <code>\1</code> as a replacement will substitute the 1st capture group, <code>\2</code> is the 2nd etc.</p>

  <p>e.g. </p>
  <code>tail sshfailed.txt | sed -E 's/^REGEX(GROUP1)REGEX(GROUP2)REGEX$/\1 \2/'</code>
  <p>results:</p>
  <div class="code">
49.88.112.72 root<br>
223.68.4.237 etienne<br>
49.88.112.72 root<br>
49.88.112.72 root<br>
159.89.89.127 postgres<br>
134.209.154.246 elle<br></div>

  <p><strong>If that works:</strong> run it on the whole file, don't use tail.</p>
  <p>Try switching the \1 and \2 or removing one.</p>
  <p><code>cat sshlog.txt | sed -E 's/^.*Disconnected from (authenticating |invalid )?user (.+) ([0-9\.]+) port.*$/\2 \3/'</code> </p>
  <p>This line captures the user in the 2nd capture group, and the IP in the 3rd. The whole line is replaced with just the "username IP"</p>

  <h3>Combine with other commands</h3>
  <p>Remember that you can use other bash commands to convert the data for you.</p>
  <p><code>sort | uniq -c | sort -nk1</code> will combine repeated values and sort them, so you can see which usernames attemted to log in the most, or which ip addresses.</p>


  <h3 id="2025-02-07h">Homework:</h3>
  <p>Create a new text file <code>05-sshlogs.txt</code> in the root of your classwork repo.</p>
  <p>PLACE a heading with your  LASTName/FIRSTName/PERIOD at the top of the text file.</p>
  <h4>Directions:</h4>
  <p>Answer the questions below </p>
  <p>If you used a command to calculate the result, <strong>submit the command you used</strong> and an explanation of how it worked. A ballpark result is given so you know if you are close or not.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>What flag of the uniq command shows the number of duplicates?</li>
    <li>What flag of sort can sort numbers properly?</li>
    <li>How many total attempts to log in as root were there? (exclude rootroot, root1 etc.) (~3000) </li>
    <li>How many times was the account <code>user1</code> used to try to connect?  </li>
    <li>How many unique IP addresses tried to connect as root? (~20ish) if you exclude rootroot, root1, root2 etc.)</li>
    <li>How many unique account names used to connect? (~300ish)</li>
    <li>Which account was used to try to connect the 4<sup>th</sup> most frequently? (hint sort!)</li>
    <li>How many ip addressses tried to connect more than 50 times?</li>
    <li>Find the 10 least frequent accounts that connected more than 10 times,and how many times they were used. (hint uniq can count how many when you are removing duplicates. (test1,etc...))</li>
  </ol>

  <h5>2025-02-06</h5>
  <h3>Quiz</h3>
  <p>Next week you will have a quiz on terminal commands and regex. I don't know which day yet, but this is a nice way to give a narrow scope of topics.</p>
  <p>From regexlearn.com (up to 44), you need it all except for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> Non-capturing Grouping</li>
    <li>look-ahead</li>
    <li>look-behind</li>
    <li>Flags</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Using regex with grep</h3>
  <p>grep requires the -E  (Extended) flag for full regex support, otherwise it has only a subset of what we learned. This is true for many regex compatible tools, though the flag may be different.</p>




  <h3>New useful terminal commands</h3>
  <p>tr - Translate, squeeze, and/or delete characters from standard input, writing to standard output.</p>
  <p>-d (delete)</p>
  <p>-s (squeeze repeats)</p>
  <p>Let us use tr to help us do some manipulation of a text file...</p>
  <ul>
      <li>replace uppercase with lowercase</li>
      <li>replace spaces with newlines</li>
      <li>squeeze multiple repeats into a single</li>
      <li>delete all puinctuation</li>
  </ul>


  <h3>What else can we do with these tools?</h3>
  <pre>cat FILENAME | tr -d '[:punct:]' | tr ' ' '\n' |
    tr -s '\n' | tr "[A-Z]" "[a-z]" |
    \grep  -vx -f /usr/share/dict/american-english -i</pre>
  <p>I excaped grep because of a macro, \command will make you use the command WITHOUT resolving an alias.</p>
  <p>e.g. if you have <code>alias rm=rm -i</code> then <code>\rm FILENAME</code> will ignore the alias and not use the -i </p>


  <h3>Remember the clues from the scavenger hunt?</h3>
  <p>Look at the extra command at the end of this chain:</p>
  <pre>grep -r "### Clue" | sort -k 3n |
    sed -E 's/(.*)\/.* Clue (.*): .*/Clue:\2 Folder:\1/'</pre>
  <p>What are the parameters in between the "/" in sed? </p>
  <p>We shall now look at sed, the strem editor.</p>

  <h3>Edit the stream:</h3>
  <p>sed is a stream editing program, the way we will use it is for text replacement:</p>
  <p><code>sed -E 's/target/replacement/'</code> where -E is for extended regex.</p>

  <h4>Matching up to a specific word(or words)</h4>
  <p>Given this data file called 'words':</p>
  <pre><code>a fish bites
a dog barks
the dog runs
many fish fly
many fish fry
my dog sleeps
  </code></pre>
<p>If you want to match UP TO a string or multiple strings you can do the following:</p>
<p><code>cat words |  sed -E 's/^.*(dog |fish )//'</code> will replace everything UP TO dog or fish and replace with nothing.</p>
<p> <code>cat words | sed -E 's/.*(dog|fish).*/\1/'</code> will capture the entire line and replace it with capture group 1. The \1 in the replacement field stands for capture group 1.</p>
<p>This effectively strips away all parts on the left and right side of the words we wanted. Now lets try to combine our regex powers...</p>

<h3>Using this hands on:</h3>
<h4>ssh can take command line arguments!</h4>
<p>Passing a string into ssh at the end of the line, will cause ssh to run that string on the remote host!</p>
<p>So <code>ssh bob@marge.stuy.edu "cd Documents; ls"</code> would show you the contents of the Documents folder on marge, then exit the ssh program.</p>

<h4>Getting some ssh logs:</h3>

<p>You need sudo for this so you can try it on your own linux devices: <code>ssh myserver "journalctl | grep sshd" > sshlog.txt</code> </p>
<p>Now filter the <code>sshlog.txt</code> only the disconnections, and also dump it to a local file:</p>
<p>I have placed <code>/tmp/sshlog.txt</code> on marge for you to retrieve. What commands can get the file?</p>
<p>Get this file now, you can use many commands, scp being the most obvious. I will frequently ask you to get files, you need this skill.</p>

  <p>There are regex quick references all over the internet, but just a few things here:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>^ : the start of the line</li>
  <li>$ : the end of the line</li>
  <li>. : any single character except newline</li>
  <li>* : zero or more of the preceding match</li>

  <li>? : zero or one of the preceding match</li>
  <li>(a|b) : either something that matches a or b</li>
  <li>[abc] : any one character of a, b, and c</li>
  <li>^ : can also be used inside of [] to negate the result</li>
  <li>\b : a word boundary</li>
  <li>\s is a shorthand for [ \t\r\n\f] which is whitespace characters (tab newline space etc.)</li>

  <li>x{n} : Where "n" is a positive integer, matches exactly "n" occurrences of the preceding item "x". </li>
  <li>x{n,m} :	Where "n" is 0 or a positive integer, "m" is a positive integer, and m > n, matches at least "n" and at most "m" occurrences of the preceding item "x". </li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can use these (and more options) to find or validate strings.</p>
  <p>Create a regex that will match some of the following words but not the rest using what you know of regex:</p>
  <p>Two or more consecutive z's in the middle of non-z's.</p>
	<pre>--match:
wazzzzzzzup
wazzup
skip:
wazup
waup
aszbczasdf
zabczz
zzzzzz
zzzaaaazzz
  </pre>

  <p>even number of consecutive z's but not 0, in the middle of non-z's.</p>
  <pre>--match:
wazzzzzzup
wazzzzup
wazzup
--skip:
wazup
wazuzp
wazzzup
fazzzup
fazzzuli
zzfaulizzzz</pre>
<p>Use capture groups, not a 3 way or statement.</p>
 <pre>match:
timtim-tim
kimkim-kim
jimjim-jim
skip: all other patterned words
timtan-tim
kimtim-tim
rintin-tin
jimjim-kim
etc.
</pre>

<h3>Regex realtime preview is helpful</h3>
<p>I often use <a href="https://regex101.com/">https://regex101.com/</a> to validate my regular expressions.</p>
<p>*I absolutely needed to use it when I haven't touched regex in a while, or when my expression is complicated.</p>

<p>Also remember you have other sites to give you some regex help:</p>
<a href="https://regexlearn.com/learn/regex101">https://regexlearn.com/learn/regex101</a>
<p>or here: </p>
<a href="https://regexone.com/">https://regexone.com/</a>

<p>What kinds of strings does the following expressions match? </p>
<div class="code">
  A: \bR[a-z]{4,10}e\b</br>
  B: \bR[a-zA-Z]{4,10}[e|E]\b
</div>
<p>Here are some test strings, decide if each string matches regex A , B or both</p>
<ol>
  <li>Reeeee</li>

  <h3 id="2025-02-05h">Homework 04:</h3>
  <p>Submit in your classwork directory with the filename <code>04-regex.txt</code> this should be a plain text document.</p>
  <h2>Urgent</h2>
  <p>Your homework is to show multiple expressions per question. <strong>If you just submit your answer, then you will get NO credit</strong> .</p>
  <p>Show the evolution of your answer by including <strong> EACH expression that you went through to get to your final answer!</strong> </p>
  <p>Put a heading on your file: </p>
  <pre>Last,First,Period
HW##,DATE</pre>


  <h3>Question 1</h3>

  <p>Write a regex that checks for valid names.</p>
  <p>You will be submitting as many expressions as you needed to built up the final answer. You do not have to inflate this quantity but it should be more than 1 for sure.</p>
  <h4>What is a valid name?</h4>
  <p>A valid name consists of the following:</p>
  <p>first name, an optional middle name or initial, and a last name, separated by spaces.</p>
  <p>First, middle and last names start with a capital letter and are followed by one or more lowercase letters.</p>
  <p>If the name has a middle initial, instead of a middle name, it must be a capital letter followed by a period. </p>
  <p>Sorry we are lumping 2 part first names or two part last names into "middle names" to simplify things. We are also not including titles like junior, senior, esquire etc.</p>
  <p>Examples you should paste into <a href="https://regex101.com/">https://regex101.com/</a> </p>

    <pre>MATCH:
Joe Public
Xiao Xiao Mao
Joe Q. Public
Joe Quincy Public
Ferris Buler
William M. Mason
David Copperfield

DO NOT MATCH:
Joe P.
Omae wa mou shindeiru
Joe Q Public
Joe Qu. Public
Joe Quincy Reginald Public
Joe Quincy Public, the Third
Dave P.
Little Richard III</pre>
  <p>Your answer should be something like this (spaces will represent actual spaces):</p>
  <pre> [a-z]* [a-z]* [a-z]*</pre>

  <p>To match a whole line, so that you don't get partial names, we use the ^ for the start of the line, and $ for the end of the line.</p>
  <pre>^[a-z]* [a-z]* [a-z]*$</pre>

  <p>Lets not forget some last names are hyphenated!</p>
  <p>optional: (Hyphenated last names with upper case)</p>
  <pre>
Abby Smith-Fitzgerald
Aerating A. Silver-Kimono
Joe Quincy Public-Defender</pre>

<h3>Question 2</h3>
<h4>Part a</h4>
<p>First match IPV4 address formats, four numbers separated by periods. E.g <code>1.2.3.4</code>, <code>192.168.1.24</code>, etc. </p>

<h4>Part b: keep updating your regex</h4>
<p>Update your answer to REJECT invalid ip addresses. Each of the four numbers must be between 0 and 255. There should be NO leading zeros.</p>
<p>Accept: (but not limited to these)</p>
<pre>1.1.1.1
255.0.0.255
192.168.1.255

  <h3>Scavenger Hunt all clues<h3>
  <p>I used grep as follows:</p>
  <code>grep -r "### Clue"</code>
  <p>However the output was ugly so:</p>
  <code>grep -r "### Clue" | sort -k 3n</code>
  <p>This uses the 3rd item in each row as sorting key, and treats it like a number.</p>
  <p>Since I still thought this was ugly...</p>
  <code> grep -r "### Clue" | sort -k 3n | sed -E 's/(.*)\/.* Clue (.*): .*/Clue:\2 Folder:\1/' </code>
  <p>I didn't teach you sed, but the (.*) are capturing the characters before the first slash, and the characters between "Clue " and the
  ":" then outputs them in a nice format</p>
  <p>Regular expressions are very useful in pattern matching and manipulating</p>

  <h3>prerequisite terminal skills:</h3>
  <ul>
   <li>Opening a terminal</li>
   <li>Creating folders and files in the location you want</li>
   <li>Copying/Moving/Editing files</li>
   <li>Using SSH to run commands on another computer</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>TTY sessions</h3>
  <p>TTY used to refer to a physical TeleTYpewriter which was a machine that connected remotely but now is just refers to one of the terminals connected to the machine.</p>
  <p>You can access tty4 (ctrl-alt-f4) and tty5 (ctrl-alt-f5) before you log in, and then you will have to log in to that tty session.</p>
  <p>Make sure you <code>exit</code> your tty session before you leave the computer, as it does not lock the screen or log you out!</p>
  <p>Nothing screams "script kiddie"* like someone using a TTY session to show off then forgetting to log out and getting their information stolen</p>
  <p>*Look up script kiddie</p>
  <p>
  Using a tty session is sometimes good practice to see how well you fare without the GUI. You OFTEN need to interact with
     remote computers via ssh, giving you only terminal access, so this is in fact a useful skill, not a bragging point.
  <p>

  <h3>cheat.sh</h3>
  <p>How to get help in a terminal assuming you have web access?</p>
  <p>http://cheat.sh is a website that has examples of how to use linux commands in different ways. This is often more useful than man pages when you don't know how a command is used.</p>
  <p>Accessing cheat.sh from a browser when you are in a terminal may not be ideal, so there is a quick way to get the info on your current terminal:</p>
  <p><code>curl cheat.sh/COMMAND_TO_LOOK_UP</code> </p>
  <p>Note: curl stands for Client URL</p>

  <h3>Plumbing</h3>
  <p>The linux system has a large variety of commands that do small things. By combining these tools you can accomplish a very large variety of results.</p>
  <p><strong>ls</strong> lists files and directories but has many flags to make it more useful.</p>
  <p><strong>wc</strong> counts the number of lines, words and characters in a block of text. </p>
  <p><strong>sort</strong> will sort a block of text alphabetically</p>
  <p><strong>uniq</strong> can replace duplicate entries with a single entery, and optionally count the number of repeats </p>
  <p><strong>sed</strong> stream edit, lets you modify a stream like standard out in real time as it is printed.</p>
  <p>Remember you can <code>curl cheat.sh/COMMAND</code> if you need some examples/hints/help</p>

  <h3>Demo From Class:</h3>
  <p>You can give a command parameters:</p>
  <pre>cowsay Moooo!</pre>
  <p>Or you can pipe | commands into another command:</p>
  <pre>fortune | cowsay</pre>
  <p>You can pipe the output of several program into eachother:</p>
  <pre>fortune | cowsay | lolcat</pre>
  <p>You can also use loops on the shell:</p>
  <pre>while true; do date '+%D %T' |
    toilet -f term -F border |
    lolcat; sleep 1; done</pre>

  <h2>Homework</h2>

    <h3>Regular Expressions (regex):</h3>
    <p>1. Spend 20 minutes to familiarize yourself with either regex tutorial so you get an idea of how this works before tomorrow.</p>
    <a href="https://regexlearn.com/learn/regex101">https://regexlearn.com/learn/regex101</a>
    <p>or here: </p>
    <a href="https://regexone.com/">https://regexone.com/</a>
    <p>2. Try to apply regex using this testing site: <a href="https://regex101.com/">https://regex101.com/</a> </p>
    <p>Your goal is to try to see in realtime how the regex expression matches text</p>
    <p>You should use ^ and $ operators for line boundaries as well.</p>
    <p>Here is some sample text to work with, try to match ONLY the usernames, try to match ONLY the IP addresses:</p>
    <p>You will want to use capture groups for this, so you can match parts of the whole line e.g. "(.*) sshd.*" would capture "Feb 06 10:15:28 marge" from each line in the group designated by the parenthesis.</p>
    <pre><code>Feb 06 10:15:28 marge sshd[1983193]: Failed password for root from 218.92.0.76 port 24168 ssh2
Feb 06 10:15:30 marge sshd[1983195]: Failed password for root from 61.177.172.160 port 18985 ssh2
Feb 06 10:15:39 marge sshd[1983202]: Failed password for invalid user min from 43.153.223.232 port 41606 ssh2
Feb 06 10:15:42 marge sshd[1983200]: Failed password for root from 61.177.172.160 port 37258 ssh2
Feb 06 10:15:49 marge sshd[1983207]: Failed password for invalid user bodega from 34.66.142.113 port 43408 ssh2
Feb 06 10:16:02 marge sshd[1983216]: Failed password for root from 180.101.88.241 port 49238 ssh2
Feb 06 10:16:02 marge sshd[1983218]: Failed password for invalid user btest from 43.163.226.99 port 50308 ssh2</code></pre>

    <p>
      Note: I absolutely need to use <a href="https://regex101.com/">https://regex101.com/</a>
      to help me tweak my expressions, it is like having a compiler for a language.

  <h5> 2025/02/03 </h5>

  <h2>It was GROUNDHOG DAY!</h2>
  <img width="400px" src="img/groundhogDay.jpg" alt="Bill Murray with a groundhog driving a truck.">

  <h3>Policies / Late work / etc</h3>
  <p>Class policies are on the landing page (click on the snake)</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Software you need to know about</h2>
  <p>
    You will have to learn how to install a variety of tools. Installations are specific to your OS,
    but you can just follow the directions in most cases.
  </p>

  <h3>Windows Users:</h3>
  <p>
    windows 10 or 11 let you run linux in a window:
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install">WSL</a>
    (Windows subsystem for linux is actually a linux subsystem for windows...)
  </p>
  <p>
    If you don't want to use linux or you also want to install tools to use with powershell,
    then look into <a href="https://chocolatey.org/">chocolatey</a>
  </p>

  <h3>For linux: sudo</h3>
  <p>
    sudo is a program already installed on unix and linux operating systems that enables users to run programs
    with the security privileges of another user, by default the superuser.
  </p>
  <p>
    You do NOT have sudo permission on the school system,
    but you do on your personal devices, and on your WSL installation.
  </p>
  <p>Windows does not have an equivalent command.</p>


  <h3>Installing software / Updating</h3>
  <p>On your linux distributions, you often can install software with a single command in the terminal!</p>

  <p>Prior to installing anything you should update:</p>
  <h4>update your linux first:</h4>
  <pre><code>sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade</code> </pre>

  <h4>Then install software you need: (cowsay is an example)</h4>
  <pre><code>sudo apt install cowsay</code> </pre>


  <h3>grep</h3>
  <p>Regarding grep: g/re/p <strong>G</strong>lobally search for a <strong>R</strong>egular <strong>E</strong>xpression and <strong>P</strong>rint matching lines</p>
  <p>grep is a great filtering tool to help reduce large outputs to just the parts you care about.</p>

  <h3>Python</h3>
  <p> Both <strong>Python 2 and 3</strong> are very useful. Some programs only exist in one version or the other, so it is always helpful to be able to use either.</p>
  <p>Even if you do not plan on coding in python it is useful to be able to run commands in both python 2 and 3. When you install both, you must be careful which you are actually running.</p>
  <p>Do not use the command <code>python</code> in your scripts/makefiles. When writing scripts you should <strong>explicitly call <code>python2</code> or <code>python3</code> </strong> rather than assume that <code>python</code> will call the correct version!</p>


  <h3>Shell configuration</h3>
  <p>You do not have to keep your shell in the default configuration.</p>
  <p>Bash has a <code>.bashrc</code> file, zsh has a <code>.zshrc</code> file. In these files (and a few others like <code>.bash_profile</code> ) you can add customizations such as aliasing commands to other commands with particular arguments.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> <code>alias python="python3"</code> would default the python command to always be python3, this would not impact your ability to use python2 or python3 commands. It would affect how your scripts are run on your computer, but NOT how it would run on soemone else's computer! </li>
    <li> <code>alias rm='rm -i'</code> would make every rm command ask for confirmation before deleting.</li>
    <li> I have a colorized cat program in <code>~/bin/</code> and I aliased cat to it as follows: <code>alias cat='~/bin/ccat -G String="green" -G Plaintext="bold" -G Keyword="blue" -G Punctuation="red"'</code> </li>
  </ul>


  <h3>VPN</h3>
  <p>We will be using openVPN for accessing some cybersecurity resources.</p>

  <h2>Make</h2>
  <p>Make is a program to easily run other programs!</p>
  <p> <strong>make</strong> is a command that we will be using for labs. If you use windows your gitbash doesn't have this tool.</p>
  <p>On windows you have to download <a href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm">Make for windows</a>  </p>
  <p>On wsl or linux you can just run: <code>sudo apt install build-essential</code></p>

  <h3>Makefiles</h3>
  <p>Make is configured to do whatever you need it to do using a file you create that is named "makefile".</p>
  <p>This allows developers to distribute software to other developers without having to wory about complex compilation/configuration steps.</p>

  <h3>Makefile syntax</h3>
  <p>To use make, you will need to be very careful with tabs vs spaces.</p>
  <p>Because java automatically compiles required files, and python doesn't require compilation, the dependancies do not seem important. They are in many languages, they are not used here to keep things simple.</p>

  <p>syntax of a typical rule: (note tabs won't display as tabs in a website, so aways use 1 tab to indicate a recipe)</p>


  <code>
  <p>.PHONY: run clean</p>
  <p>target: prerequisites</p>
  <p>&lt;TAB&gt;recipe</p>
  <p>target2: prerequisites</p>
  <p>&lt;TAB&gt;recipe2</p>
  </code>
  <p>That is the tab character (tab key), not the symbols written.</p>
  <p>target are often FILES that the recipe will make.</p>
  <p>Prerequesites are any FILES that are required to run the recipe.</p>
  <p>The .PHONY commands are examples of targets that are NOT files. You should avoid making files that overlap the run commands, e.g. do not make a program called "run" if you want to use "make run" to execute that program.</p>

  <h3>Examples of makefiles:</h3>
  <p> <strong>URGENT NOTE:</strong> these examples are not copy/paste-able because websites don't display tab characters.
   You must ensure text is left justified or tabbed over once!</p>

  <code><pre>run:
 python2 file.py</pre></code>

  <p>A simple recipe to run a command: (you cannot copy paste this as web browsers do not use "tab" and makefiles REQUIRE tab indentation)</p>
  <code><pre>say_hello:
    echo "Hello World"</pre></code>


  <p>Now run the file by typing make inside the directory that contains the makefile. The output will be:</p>
  <code><pre>$ make
echo "Hello World"
Hello World
$ </pre></code>

  <p>You can put comments at the top of your makefile. You can also make multiple targets. The first target is the "default" which is run when no arguments are provided to the make program.</p>
  <code><pre># Usage:
# make        : compile all java files
# make runs   : run the program
# make clean  : remove all class files
.PHONY: run clean default
default:
    javac *.java
run:
    java Driver
clean:
    rm *.class</pre></code>


  <p>You can pass arguments into your programs using makefile too! </p>
  <code><pre># Usage:
# make run ARGS=filename
# also note the @ before echo, this will not echo the command on the terminal
# you can test it both ways to see the difference.
.PHONY: run default
default:
    @echo "example: make run ARGS=textfile.txt"
run:
    python File.py $(ARGS)</pre></code>
  <p>Final note on makefiles, after you test them and they work, you should add @ before each command so you do not see the command itself, only the output.</p>
  <code><pre># Usage:
# make        : compile all java files
# make runs   : run the program
# make clean  : remove all class files
.PHONY: run clean
run: Driver.class
    @java Driver
Driver.class: Driver.java
    @javac Driver.java
clean:
    @rm *.class</pre></code>
  <h4>Dependencies</h4>
  <p>The above includes an example of dependency usage.</p>

  <h3>More notes on makefiles</h3>
  <p>You can find more information on makefiles here: <a href="http://konstantinnovation.github.io/systems.html#2024-09-16n">http://konstantinnovation.github.io/systems.html#2024-09-16n</a> </p>

  <hr>
  <h2 id="2025-02-03h">Lab00</h2>
  <p>This is a test lab to ensure you can use the tools required for future labs.</p>
  <p>You must always test your labs on the StuyCS Lab computers, to avoid any compatibility issues.</p>
  <p><a href="https://classroom.github.com/a/in8yfTB0">https://classroom.github.com/a/in8yfTB0</a> </p>
  <h4>The goal is to use and test a makefile</h4>
  <ol>
  <li>
	  <p>Write a program in either python/java/c that does the following:</p>
	  <p>when the arguments are -u and a string: Uppercase a string</p>
	  <p>when the arguments are -l and a string: Lowercase a string</p>

  </li>
  <li>
	  <p>Create a makefile to use with your program. If you have difficulty read directions, and ask on piazza</p>
	  <p>create a makefile with the following targets:</p>
	  <p>default     : compile if needed</p>
	  <p>make clean  : remove any compiled files</p>
	  <p>make run $ARGS="args go here"   : compile ONLY if needed, then run the program with the arguments provided in the ARGS string.</p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Example:</h4>
  <p>The first make will compile. The other make run commands will run your program.</p>
  <code><pre>$make
$make run ARGS="-u asdf"
ASDF
$make run ARGS="-l aSdF1"
asdf1
$</pre></code>
  <p>Notice no output when typing make.</p>

  <h2>Terminal-Fu</h2>
  <p><img src="img/terminalfu.jpg" alt=""> </p>
  <h3>the -fu suffix:</h3>
  <p>From: <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-fu">https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-fu</a> </p>
  <p>-fu : (slang) Used to form nouns indicating expertise or mastery of specified skill or area of knowledge.</p>
  <ul>
    ‎<li>Google + ‎-fu → ‎Google-fu
    ‎<li>script + ‎-fu → ‎script-fu
    <li>My Google-fu is weak!
    <li>Aragorn uses Ranger-fu to figure out that Sam and Frodo have taken a boat.
  </ul>
  <h4>Etymology</h4>
  <p>From kung-fu.</p>


  <h3>Some extra Resources</h3>
  <p><a href="https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview">https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview</a></p>
  <p>What is a terminal emulator based on? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT100">VT100 Terminal</a> </p>

  <h3>Terminal vs Shell</h3>
  <p>Terminal and shell are often used interchangeably much like arguments vs parameters.</p>
  <p>The terminal (Actually a terminal emulator) is the window that connects to another machine. This is based on a physical device called a terminal.</p>
  <p>The shell is the program running on the machine that is parsing your commands.</p>


  <h3>Common Problems</h3>
  <p>Often typing commands that you know, will cause results you do not expect.</p>
  <p>Echo is a simple command that prints to the terminal whatever text you give it.</p>
  <pre class="codeblock"><code>
  $ echo hello, goodbye
  hello, goodbye
  $ echo "hello, goodbye"
  hello, goodbye
  $</code></pre>
  <p>But if you mistype it:</p>
  <pre class="codeblock"><code>
  $ echo "hello, goodbye
  ></code></pre>
  <p>Oh No! You are stuck! </p>
  <p>There are several ways to fix this. One is to close your quotations, the other is to press Ctrl-C and ending the command.</p>
  <h3>Your 2nd best friend: ctrl-c</h3>
  Here are some examples of commands that will make your terminal get stuck in some way:
  <ul>
    <li>$ echo "hello</li>
    <li>$ grep foobar</li>
    <li>$ yes</li>
    <li>$ tail</li>
    <li>$ cat</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In every case, the solution is the same: hit Ctrl-C (pronounced "control-see"). Ctrl-C is sometimes written as ⌃C</p>

  <h3>Your best friend: Tab (the key above capslock)</h3>
  <p>When typing commands into the shell, many shells will allow for some form of autocompletion. The tab key triggers the auto complete functionality.</p>

  <h3>Other tools that you should know:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>cd</li>
    <li>cp and mv</li>
    <li>scp</li>
    <li>cat</li>
    <li>nano / micro</li>
    <li>ssh</li>
    <li>If you like to suffer:  vim , emacs</li>
  </ul>




  <h3>SSH</h3>
  <p>ssh is a secure shell program that lets you connect your terminal to a shell on a remote computer.
     This is used to run commands on that remote computer as if you were logged into it (because you log into it remotely).
   </p>

  <pre>
    <code>ssh username@hostAddress</code>
  </pre>
  <p>The machines in this lab are all open to be ssh'ed using your STUYCS accounts.</p>
  <p>Marge is <pre>149.89.161.100</pre> please do NOT use marge for general work.</p>
  <p>All other machines are: <pre>149.89.161.1xx</pre> where xx is 01,02,03,... 31,32</p>
  <p>The command <pre>ssh username@149.89.161.100</pre> would try to connect to marge, and ask your for your password for the cs lab.</p>
  <p>From marge, you can <pre>ssh username@149.89.161.115</pre> to connect to <code>cslab4-15</code> </p>


  <h3>Classwork Repo</h3>
  <p>Please clone and use this repo to store your day to day files and a few homework assignments: <a href="https://classroom.github.com/a/B6E-H1jV">https://classroom.github.com/a/B6E-H1jV</a> </p>


    <h3>Scavenger hunt!</h3>

    <p><strong>YOU MUST NOT CLONE THIS IN YOUR HOME DIRECTORY!!!!</strong></p>

    <p>You will use your last 4 digits of your osis as your <strong>random seed</strong> so you do not forget it.</p>
    <p>
      You can continue your scavenger hunt on another machine because you can recreate the scavenger hunt with
      the same <strong>random seed</strong> as last time. You can SSH back into the lab computers, and recreate the hunt if it got deleted.
    </p>


    <p>You will be logging your scavenger hunt so please read the how to submit section!</p>
    <p>To get started:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>
    <pre><code>mkdir /tmp/`whoami`;cd /tmp/`whoami`;git clone https://github.com/pushingice/scavenger-hunt.git</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Now you must read the README carefully and follow directions.</p>
    <p>Use the last4 digits of your osis as your secret number. (random seed)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>If you get lost please use: <pre><code>cd /tmp/`whoami`/scavenger-hunt</code></pre></p>

    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Try the hunt as it is intended, and when you finish it will show you a cool method you could have hacked the hunt from the start! </p>
    <p><strong>Do not look into the python files, or use your python-fu to get your clues</strong> as that completely circumvents the purpose of this activity.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>If "which python" doesn't work as intended, try using "" as the result instead of "no python found" or similar.</p>
    </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Remember you can have more than one terminal open, for example one to display your information, and another to test commands.</p>
    <p>Note that the whoami command prints your username to stdout. The backticks insert the results of that into the terminal command.</p>


    <h3>How to submit:</h3>

    <p>Make a file: <code>01-scavenger.txt</code> in the root of your classwork repo. </p>
    <p>This should be a plain text document no other file types!</p>
    <p>The file should contain: your name, seed, and all 12 of y our clues in the format:</p>

    <pre class="codeblock"><code>Period,Last,First
seed
problem#,LOCATION, explanation how did you get this location
problem#,LOCATION, explanation how did you get this location
...
explanation at the end</code></pre>
    <p>Your hint is exactly what you give to the nextclue command.</p>
    <p>Problem 12 requires an explanation of how you found it.</p>
    <p>After 12, please write an explanation of how easy/hard the hunt was for you, and if you used any alternative ways to find the solution(s)</p>
    <p>e.g.</p>
    <pre class="codeblock"><code>09,Smith,Kenji
0210  #the seed (secret number needed for your quest.)
1,README, Mr.K told me to go here...
2,50240, the command foo gave me the hint fish
3,12394, using ls and combining the results got the hint 123
4,54133, i used the sudo command to pwn all
...(more lines)
12,20042,????
It was hard until I decided to used magic! The magic of the terminal! (not a good response)</code></pre>
    <p>Try your best, and don't worry if you get stuck! Posting on piazza will help you un-stuck yourself.</p>
    <p>There are ways around any commands that don't work due to permissions.</p>

  <h2>Cyber Hygiene</h2>


  <h3>Terminology</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>hacker, attacker, intruder : People who seek to exploit weakness in computer systems for their own gain.</li>
    <li>vulnerability : Flaws in software, firmware, or hardware that can be exploited by anattacker to perform unauthorized operations on a system.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Hacking</h3>
  <p>~1950 MIT students. or 2024 Chinese/Russian government employees?</p>
  <p>
    The original use of the term hacker dates back to 1950-1960s at MIT.
    Students there enjoyed learning about and experimenting with technology.
    A hack was something innovative/ingenious in the arena of computers and technology.
    This positive connotation exists today in expressions like "life hacks"
    "cooking hacks" etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    This has evolved somewhat, and it is sometimes confusing because 'hacker' can
    have a positive or negative connotation: a creative engineering person, versus a cyber attacker, or even both.
  </p>
  <h3>Hacker Classification</h3>
  <p>Hackers can be classified into three different categories:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>White Hat - Ethical Hackers.
      The "good guys" that use their skills to help protect against attacks / find and report vulnerabilities / design secure systems etc.
      They have permission to try to hack into and detect vulnerabilities.
      They act in an open and professional manner to differentiate themselves from malicious hackers.

    </li>
    <li>Black Hat - Malicious Hackers.
      The "bad guys" that use their skills for malicious purposes.
      They can steal money and information or damage systems.
    </li>
    <li>Grey Hat - They do not have permission to gain access to a company's system or products,
      but find exploits with the intent of highlighting the problem. (often seeking a bounty/reward for doing so, not just going after posted bug bounties)
      They do not have malicious intent but their actions may be illegal.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2><p>What is at risk? How can you protect yourself?</p></h2>
  <h3> What are possible losses due to a cyber attack?</h3>

  <p>Let us consider the possible impacts of cyber attacks? Think what can happen if you don't protect digital data and infrastructure...</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Financial</li>
    <li>Resource Unavailability / Misuse</li>
    <li>Data Loss</li>
    <li>Identity Theft</li>
    <li>Loss of Trust/Reputation</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Identity Theft</h3>
  <p>A crime where an attacker uses information that identifies a person for personal gain. </p>

  <p><strong>Data At Risk:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Name, Address, Phone number,</li>
    <li>DOB, SSN</li>
    <li>Credit Card / Bank info</li>
    <li>Driver's License / Passport</li>
  </ul>


  <strong>Effects of Identity Theft:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Loss of money:   Bank / Credit card fraud</li>
    <li>Actual Identity: Government ID or document theft/usage</li>
  </ul>



  <h3>What can an individual do to protect themselves?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Regularly Updating OS and applications</li>
    <li>Strong Passwords</li>
    <li>Antivirus*</li>
    <li>Change default usernames and passwords</li>
    <li>Use MFA (multi factor authentication)</li>
    <li>Backup of important Files</li>
    <li>Using encryption and Digital Signatures</li>
    <li>Firewalls and intrusion detection systems</li>
    <li>Be suspicious of all email. Expected or otherwise</li>
    <li>Not revealing too much personal information on social networks</li>
    <li>Awareness of present world security scenarios and new attacks</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>*Regarding antivirus</h4>
  <p>Sometimes free antivirus isn't worth having. While Avast, AVG, and several other providers
    offer a free tier of protection, they are often filled with advertizemnts for the upgraded
    veresion of protection.</p>
  <p>Microsoft's windows defender is a great free option, but you may want to supplement that with something for your web browsing, or for additional malware detection.</p>



    <h2 id="2025-01-30h">Homework02:</h2>
  <h3>1. Your data</h3>
  <p>Back up all of your STUYCS lab data somewhere else. Your data is not protected and can be erased at any time. </p>
  <p>If you have anything that is not in a github repository, you might want to make one to store your old work (intro etc).</p>
  <p>Any GitHub repositories that you do not OWN (everything on GitHub classrooms), should be forked so you have a copy that you do in fact own, provided you wish to maintain it.</p>

  <h3>2. What you should you be doing now: (if you want to be safe)</h3>
  <p>The following are good practices that you should aim to do/start doing as soon as you can. There is no deadline and I won't check, but they will make you safer overall.</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Update all of your software</li>
  <li>Turn on multi factor authentication for all of your accounts that support it.</li>
  <li>Migrate to a password manager. (Bitwarden or similar, do NOT use LastPass)</li>
  <li>Change all of your (important) passwords to a 16+ character long randomized string using your password manager prioritizing your most important accounts and working your way down the list.</li>
  <li>Install / Update (regularly) a reputable antivirus*</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>2025-01-28</h5>

  <h2>1. Expectations and Prior Knowledge</h2>

  <h3>Language Familiarity</h3>
  <p>All students are expected to be proficient in Java/Processing, and possibly other languages as well.</p>
  <p>While you are not required to know multiple lanugages, it would allow you to pick the best tool for the job on a lab where you are allowed to use any language you choose.</p>
  <p>It is very useful to know python in addition to a more strongly typed language.</p>

  <h3>Termial Familiarity</h3>
  <p>I expect you all have had experience working with a terminal, and working with github. If you avoided using the terminal in the past, you have now run out of time to practice and will required to use it going forward.</p>
  <p>This is a good place to see some of the basic skills you will all need:   <a href="https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview">https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview</a> </p>
  <p>I will go over commands and make them part of future assignments, but doing this now (when you are not swamped with other work) would make your later portions of the class go more smoothly.</p>
  <p>You are expected to be able to use the lab machines (and hopefully your personal devices) to be able to view/edit files and more. In the lab I expect that all students would be able to create a file in a particular directory and paste/edit code fairly quickly. (e.g. Paste some code into <code>Documents/cyber/classwork/2025-01-28/Demo.java</code> ) </p>
  <p></p>

  <h3>Working environment</h3>
  <p>
    Part of this course will be making sure you are able to use a wide variety of tools.
    Even though some tools will be replicated in a web based sandbox, there are
    instances where you will need to demonstrate you can use those tools outside
    of the sandbox (from your personal device).</p>
  <p>Please ensure you have a working linux os on your personal device.</p>
  <p>If you have a mac or linux computer, you already have one!</p>
  <h3>Mac</h3>
  <p>To work on a Mac computer you must install Xcode from the App Store. Run the following in a terminal in install xcode command line tools: <pre>xcode-select --install</code></pre> </p>
  <h3>Windows</h3>
  <p>Windows users can install WSL (a linux virtual machine) on your windows computers:</p>
  <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install</a>

  <h3>Danger! Don't be stupid.</h3>
  <p>Anything you learn in this class can be used legally on your own computers, or with any computers you get permission to use. You must never "test out that cool thing" without permission.</p>
  <p>Crimes involving computers tend to be felonies and the prosecution has a lot of incentive to convict "hackers" regardless of the reasons or the scope of the crime.</p>
  <p>Please think before you act, and ask for permission before you act.</p>

  <h2>What does this course cover?</h2>

  <h2>2. What is Cybersecurity?</h2>
  <p><strong>Cybersecurity are techniques and practices that are designed to protect digital data and infrastructure. </strong></p>
  <p>There are related security fields</p>
  <p>e.g. information security or even just... security.</p>
  <p>Physically securing your infrastructure is needed to protect digital things but that is beyond the scope of cybersecurity.</p>

  <h3>Why care about learning Cybersecurity?</h3>
  <p>Before going into the "what" question, let us touch upon the in-demand nature of the field.</p>
  <p>If you enjoy things in this class there are more jobs than qualified people to take them. They are well paying jobs.</p>

  <p><strong>Basically:</strong> They are paying you to play with computers!<sup>*</sup></p>
  <p>
    <strong>*</strong>if playing with computers means being passionate about learning about a highly technical
    field and wanting to use this knowledge to do good!
  </p>

  <h3>What does Cybersecurity include?</h3>
  <p>There are many categories within cybersecurity:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Application security   </strong> - programs including operating system</li>
    <li><strong>Network and infrastructure security</strong> - including web/cloud systems</li>
    <li><strong>Intrusion detection</strong></li>
    <li><strong>penetration testing</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Digital forensics and incident response</strong> - After the fact, figure out what happened, limit damage, and prevent future incidents</li>
    <li><strong>Endpoint protection and mobile security</strong> - protecting end-user devices such as desktops, laptops, and mobile devices</li>
    <li><strong>Data governance, risk and compliance</strong> - practices to comply with government or industry rules/regulations.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These are very broad categories, <strong>penetration testing </strong> for example can be broken down further:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Physical Pen Testing</strong> - Measure the effectiveness of security procedures, training, and controls by attempting physical access to an organization.</li>
    <li><strong>External Pen Testing</strong> - Find vulnerabilities that can be exploited by external attackers to access infrastructure or data.</li>
    <li><strong>Internal Pen Testing</strong> - Determining the possible impact of an attacker getting different kinds of credientials, and the level of access required to overcome the security.</li>
    <li><strong>Web App Pen Testing</strong> -  Find technical flaws or vulnerabilities in the web aplications run by an organization</li>
    <li><strong>PCI Pen Testing</strong> - (Payment Card Industry) Validating security of credit card information.  </li>
    <li><strong>Red Teaming</strong> - Simulation of a real attack using the same tactics that attacker's would employ. This is a more holistic test.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This is not mentioning the myriad of tools and techniques required. Some of which such as Cryptography are huge topics that you can study for years.</p>
