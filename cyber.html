  <h5> 2025/02/04 </h5>
  <h3>Scavenger Hunt all clues<h3>
  <p>I used grep as follows:</p>
  <code>grep -r "### Clue"</code>
  <p>However the output was ugly so:</p>
  <code>grep -r "### Clue" | sort -k 3n</code>
  <p>This uses the 3rd item in each row as sorting key, and treats it like a number.</p>
  <p>Since I still thought this was ugly...</p>
  <code> grep -r "### Clue" | sort -k 3n | sed -E 's/(.*)\/.* Clue (.*): .*/Clue:\2 Folder:\1/' </code>
  <p>I didn't teach you sed, but the (.*) are capturing the characters before the first slash, and the characters between "Clue " and the
  ":" then outputs them in a nice format</p>
  <p>Regular expressions are very useful in pattern matching and manipulating</p>

  <h3>prerequisite terminal skills:</h3>
  <ul>
   <li>Opening a terminal</li>
   <li>Creating folders and files in the location you want</li>
   <li>Copying/Moving/Editing files</li>
   <li>Using SSH to run commands on another computer</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>TTY sessions</h3>
  <p>TTY used to refer to a physical TeleTYpewriter which was a machine that connected remotely but now is just refers to one of the terminals connected to the machine.</p>
  <p>You can access tty4 (ctrl-alt-f4) and tty5 (ctrl-alt-f5) before you log in, and then you will have to log in to that tty session.</p>
  <p>Make sure you <code>exit</code> your tty session before you leave the computer, as it does not lock the screen or log you out!</p>
  <p>Nothing screams "script kiddie"* like someone using a TTY session to show off then forgetting to log out and getting their information stolen</p>
  <p>*Look up script kiddie</p>
  <p>
  Using a tty session is sometimes good practice to see how well you fare without the GUI. You OFTEN need to interact with
     remote computers via ssh, giving you only terminal access, so this is in fact a useful skill, not a bragging point.
  <p>

  <h3>cheat.sh</h3>
  <p>How to get help in a terminal assuming you have web access?</p>
  <p>http://cheat.sh is a website that has examples of how to use linux commands in different ways. This is often more useful than man pages when you don't know how a command is used.</p>
  <p>Accessing cheat.sh from a browser when you are in a terminal may not be ideal, so there is a quick way to get the info on your current terminal:</p>
  <p><code>curl cheat.sh/COMMAND_TO_LOOK_UP</code> </p>
  <p>Note: curl stands for Client URL</p>

  <h3>Plumbing</h3>
  <p>The linux system has a large variety of commands that do small things. By combining these tools you can accomplish a very large variety of results.</p>
  <p><strong>ls</strong> lists files and directories but has many flags to make it more useful.</p>
  <p><strong>wc</strong> counts the number of lines, words and characters in a block of text. </p>
  <p><strong>sort</strong> will sort a block of text alphabetically</p>
  <p><strong>uniq</strong> can replace duplicate entries with a single entery, and optionally count the number of repeats </p>
  <p><strong>sed</strong> stream edit, lets you modify a stream like standard out in real time as it is printed.</p>
  <p>Remember you can <code>curl cheat.sh/COMMAND</code> if you need some examples/hints/help</p>

  <h3>Demo From Class:</h3>
  <p>You can give a command parameters:</p>
  <pre>cowsay Moooo!</pre>
  <p>Or you can pipe | commands into another command:</p>
  <pre>fortune | cowsay</pre>
  <p>You can pipe the output of several program into eachother:</p>
  <pre>fortune | cowsay | lolcat</pre>
  <p>You can also use loops on the shell:</p>
  <pre>while true; do date '+%D %T' |
    toilet -f term -F border |
    lolcat; sleep 1; done</pre>

  <h2>Homework</h2>

    <h3>Regular Expressions (regex):</h3>
    <p>1. Spend 20 minutes to familiarize yourself with either regex tutorial so you get an idea of how this works before tomorrow.</p>
    <a href="https://regexlearn.com/learn/regex101">https://regexlearn.com/learn/regex101</a>
    <p>or here: </p>
    <a href="https://regexone.com/">https://regexone.com/</a>
    <p>2. Try to apply regex using this testing site: <a href="https://regex101.com/">https://regex101.com/</a> </p>
    <p>Your goal is to try to see in realtime how the regex expression matches text</p>
    <p>You should use ^ and $ operators for line boundaries as well.</p>
    <p>Here is some sample text to work with, try to match ONLY the usernames, try to match ONLY the IP addresses:</p>
    <p>You will want to use capture groups for this, so you can match parts of the whole line e.g. "(.*) sshd.*" would capture "Feb 06 10:15:28 marge" from each line in the group designated by the parenthesis.</p>
    <pre><code>Feb 06 10:15:28 marge sshd[1983193]: Failed password for root from 218.92.0.76 port 24168 ssh2
Feb 06 10:15:30 marge sshd[1983195]: Failed password for root from 61.177.172.160 port 18985 ssh2
Feb 06 10:15:39 marge sshd[1983202]: Failed password for invalid user min from 43.153.223.232 port 41606 ssh2
Feb 06 10:15:42 marge sshd[1983200]: Failed password for root from 61.177.172.160 port 37258 ssh2
Feb 06 10:15:49 marge sshd[1983207]: Failed password for invalid user bodega from 34.66.142.113 port 43408 ssh2
Feb 06 10:16:02 marge sshd[1983216]: Failed password for root from 180.101.88.241 port 49238 ssh2
Feb 06 10:16:02 marge sshd[1983218]: Failed password for invalid user btest from 43.163.226.99 port 50308 ssh2</code></pre>

    <p>
      Note: I absolutely need to use <a href="https://regex101.com/">https://regex101.com/</a>
      to help me tweak my expressions, it is like having a compiler for a language.

  <h5> 2025/02/03 </h5>

  <h2>It was GROUNDHOG DAY!</h2>
  <img width="400px" src="img/groundhogDay.jpg" alt="Bill Murray with a groundhog driving a truck.">

  <h3>Policies / Late work / etc</h3>
  <p>Class policies are on the landing page (click on the snake)</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Software you need to know about</h2>
  <p>
    You will have to learn how to install a variety of tools. Installations are specific to your OS,
    but you can just follow the directions in most cases.
  </p>

  <h3>Windows Users:</h3>
  <p>
    windows 10 or 11 let you run linux in a window:
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install">WSL</a>
    (Windows subsystem for linux is actually a linux subsystem for windows...)
  </p>
  <p>
    If you don't want to use linux or you also want to install tools to use with powershell,
    then look into <a href="https://chocolatey.org/">chocolatey</a>
  </p>

  <h3>For linux: sudo</h3>
  <p>
    sudo is a program already installed on unix and linux operating systems that enables users to run programs
    with the security privileges of another user, by default the superuser.
  </p>
  <p>
    You do NOT have sudo permission on the school system,
    but you do on your personal devices, and on your WSL installation.
  </p>
  <p>Windows does not have an equivalent command.</p>


  <h3>Installing software / Updating</h3>
  <p>On your linux distributions, you often can install software with a single command in the terminal!</p>

  <p>Prior to installing anything you should update:</p>
  <h4>update your linux first:</h4>
  <pre><code>sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade</code> </pre>

  <h4>Then install software you need: (cowsay is an example)</h4>
  <pre><code>sudo apt install cowsay</code> </pre>


  <h3>grep</h3>
  <p>Regarding grep: g/re/p <strong>G</strong>lobally search for a <strong>R</strong>egular <strong>E</strong>xpression and <strong>P</strong>rint matching lines</p>
  <p>grep is a great filtering tool to help reduce large outputs to just the parts you care about.</p>

  <h3>Python</h3>
  <p> Both <strong>Python 2 and 3</strong> are very useful. Some programs only exist in one version or the other, so it is always helpful to be able to use either.</p>
  <p>Even if you do not plan on coding in python it is useful to be able to run commands in both python 2 and 3. When you install both, you must be careful which you are actually running.</p>
  <p>Do not use the command <code>python</code> in your scripts/makefiles. When writing scripts you should <strong>explicitly call <code>python2</code> or <code>python3</code> </strong> rather than assume that <code>python</code> will call the correct version!</p>


  <h3>Shell configuration</h3>
  <p>You do not have to keep your shell in the default configuration.</p>
  <p>Bash has a <code>.bashrc</code> file, zsh has a <code>.zshrc</code> file. In these files (and a few others like <code>.bash_profile</code> ) you can add customizations such as aliasing commands to other commands with particular arguments.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> <code>alias python="python3"</code> would default the python command to always be python3, this would not impact your ability to use python2 or python3 commands. It would affect how your scripts are run on your computer, but NOT how it would run on soemone else's computer! </li>
    <li> <code>alias rm='rm -i'</code> would make every rm command ask for confirmation before deleting.</li>
    <li> I have a colorized cat program in <code>~/bin/</code> and I aliased cat to it as follows: <code>alias cat='~/bin/ccat -G String="green" -G Plaintext="bold" -G Keyword="blue" -G Punctuation="red"'</code> </li>
  </ul>


  <h3>VPN</h3>
  <p>We will be using openVPN for accessing some cybersecurity resources.</p>

  <h2>Make</h2>
  <p>Make is a program to easily run other programs!</p>
  <p> <strong>make</strong> is a command that we will be using for labs. If you use windows your gitbash doesn't have this tool.</p>
  <p>On windows you have to download <a href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm">Make for windows</a>  </p>
  <p>On wsl or linux you can just run: <code>sudo apt install build-essential</code></p>

  <h3>Makefiles</h3>
  <p>Make is configured to do whatever you need it to do using a file you create that is named "makefile".</p>
  <p>This allows developers to distribute software to other developers without having to wory about complex compilation/configuration steps.</p>

  <h3>Makefile syntax</h3>
  <p>To use make, you will need to be very careful with tabs vs spaces.</p>
  <p>Because java automatically compiles required files, and python doesn't require compilation, the dependancies do not seem important. They are in many languages, they are not used here to keep things simple.</p>

  <p>syntax of a typical rule: (note tabs won't display as tabs in a website, so aways use 1 tab to indicate a recipe)</p>


  <code>
  <p>.PHONY: run clean</p>
  <p>target: prerequisites</p>
  <p>&lt;TAB&gt;recipe</p>
  <p>target2: prerequisites</p>
  <p>&lt;TAB&gt;recipe2</p>
  </code>
  <p>That is the tab character (tab key), not the symbols written.</p>
  <p>target are often FILES that the recipe will make.</p>
  <p>Prerequesites are any FILES that are required to run the recipe.</p>
  <p>The .PHONY commands are examples of targets that are NOT files. You should avoid making files that overlap the run commands, e.g. do not make a program called "run" if you want to use "make run" to execute that program.</p>

  <h3>Examples of makefiles:</h3>
  <p> <strong>URGENT NOTE:</strong> these examples are not copy/paste-able because websites don't display tab characters.
   You must ensure text is left justified or tabbed over once!</p>

  <code><pre>run:
 python2 file.py</pre></code>

  <p>A simple recipe to run a command: (you cannot copy paste this as web browsers do not use "tab" and makefiles REQUIRE tab indentation)</p>
  <code><pre>say_hello:
    echo "Hello World"</pre></code>


  <p>Now run the file by typing make inside the directory that contains the makefile. The output will be:</p>
  <code><pre>$ make
echo "Hello World"
Hello World
$ </pre></code>

  <p>You can put comments at the top of your makefile. You can also make multiple targets. The first target is the "default" which is run when no arguments are provided to the make program.</p>
  <code><pre># Usage:
# make        : compile all java files
# make runs   : run the program
# make clean  : remove all class files
.PHONY: run clean default
default:
    javac *.java
run:
    java Driver
clean:
    rm *.class</pre></code>


  <p>You can pass arguments into your programs using makefile too! </p>
  <code><pre># Usage:
# make run ARGS=filename
# also note the @ before echo, this will not echo the command on the terminal
# you can test it both ways to see the difference.
.PHONY: run default
default:
    @echo "example: make run ARGS=textfile.txt"
run:
    python File.py $(ARGS)</pre></code>
  <p>Final note on makefiles, after you test them and they work, you should add @ before each command so you do not see the command itself, only the output.</p>
  <code><pre># Usage:
# make        : compile all java files
# make runs   : run the program
# make clean  : remove all class files
.PHONY: run clean
run: Driver.class
    @java Driver
Driver.class: Driver.java
    @javac Driver.java
clean:
    @rm *.class</pre></code>
  <h4>Dependencies</h4>
  <p>The above includes an example of dependency usage.</p>

  <h3>More notes on makefiles</h3>
  <p>You can find more information on makefiles here: <a href="http://konstantinnovation.github.io/systems.html#2024-09-16n">http://konstantinnovation.github.io/systems.html#2024-09-16n</a> </p>

  <hr>
  <h2>Lab00</h2>
  <p>This is a test lab to ensure you can use the tools required for future labs.</p>
  <p>You must always test your labs on the StuyCS Lab computers, to avoid any compatibility issues.</p>
  <p><a href="https://classroom.github.com/a/in8yfTB0">https://classroom.github.com/a/in8yfTB0</a> </p>
  <h4>The goal is to use and test a makefile</h4>
  <ol>
  <li>
	  <p>Write a program in either python/java/c that does the following:</p>
	  <p>when the arguments are -u and a string: Uppercase a string</p>
	  <p>when the arguments are -l and a string: Lowercase a string</p>

  </li>
  <li>
	  <p>Create a makefile to use with your program. If you have difficulty read directions, and ask on piazza</p>
	  <p>create a makefile with the following targets:</p>
	  <p>default     : compile if needed</p>
	  <p>make clean  : remove any compiled files</p>
	  <p>make run $ARGS="args go here"   : compile ONLY if needed, then run the program with the arguments provided in the ARGS string.</p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Example:</h4>
  <p>The first make will compile. The other make run commands will run your program.</p>
  <code><pre>$make
$make run ARGS="-u asdf"
ASDF
$make run ARGS="-l aSdF1"
asdf1
$</pre></code>
  <p>Notice no output when typing make.</p>

  <h2>Terminal-Fu</h2>
  <p><img src="img/terminalfu.jpg" alt=""> </p>
  <h3>the -fu suffix:</h3>
  <p>From: <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-fu">https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-fu</a> </p>
  <p>-fu : (slang) Used to form nouns indicating expertise or mastery of specified skill or area of knowledge.</p>
  <ul>
    â€Ž<li>Google + â€Ž-fu â†’ â€ŽGoogle-fu
    â€Ž<li>script + â€Ž-fu â†’ â€Žscript-fu
    <li>My Google-fu is weak!
    <li>Aragorn uses Ranger-fu to figure out that Sam and Frodo have taken a boat.
  </ul>
  <h4>Etymology</h4>
  <p>From kung-fu.</p>


  <h3>Some extra Resources</h3>
  <p><a href="https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview">https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview</a></p>
  <p>What is a terminal emulator based on? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT100">VT100 Terminal</a> </p>
  <p>Terminal Emulators: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_terminal_emulators">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_terminal_emulators</a> </p>


  <h3>Terminal vs Shell</h3>
  <p>Terminal and shell are often used interchangeably much like arguments vs parameters.</p>
  <p>The terminal (Actually a terminal emulator) is the window that connects to another machine. This is based on a physical device called a terminal.</p>
  <p>The shell is the program running on the machine that is parsing your commands.</p>


  <h3>Common Problems</h3>
  <p>Often typing commands that you know, will cause results you do not expect.</p>
  <p>Echo is a simple command that prints to the terminal whatever text you give it.</p>
  <pre class="codeblock"><code>
  $ echo hello, goodbye
  hello, goodbye
  $ echo "hello, goodbye"
  hello, goodbye
  $</code></pre>
  <p>But if you mistype it:</p>
  <pre class="codeblock"><code>
  $ echo "hello, goodbye
  ></code></pre>
  <p>Oh No! You are stuck! </p>
  <p>There are several ways to fix this. One is to close your quotations, the other is to press Ctrl-C and ending the command.</p>
  <h3>Your 2nd best friend: ctrl-c</h3>
  Here are some examples of commands that will make your terminal get stuck in some way:
  <ul>
    <li>$ echo "hello</li>
    <li>$ grep foobar</li>
    <li>$ yes</li>
    <li>$ tail</li>
    <li>$ cat</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In every case, the solution is the same: hit Ctrl-C (pronounced "control-see"). Ctrl-C is sometimes written as âŒƒC</p>

  <h3>Your best friend: Tab (the key above capslock)</h3>
  <p>When typing commands into the shell, many shells will allow for some form of autocompletion. The tab key triggers the auto complete functionality.</p>

  <h3>Other tools that you should know:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>cd</li>
    <li>cp and mv</li>
    <li>scp</li>
    <li>cat</li>
    <li>nano / micro</li>
    <li>ssh</li>
    <li>If you like to suffer:  vim , emacs</li>
  </ul>




  <h3>SSH</h3>
  <p>ssh is a secure shell program that lets you connect your terminal to a shell on a remote computer.
     This is used to run commands on that remote computer as if you were logged into it (because you log into it remotely).
   </p>

  <pre>
    <code>ssh username@hostAddress</code>
  </pre>
  <p>The machines in this lab are all open to be ssh'ed using your STUYCS accounts.</p>
  <p>Marge is <pre>149.89.161.100</pre> please do NOT use marge for general work.</p>
  <p>All other machines are: <pre>149.89.161.1xx</pre> where xx is 01,02,03,... 31,32</p>
  <p>The command <pre>ssh username@149.89.161.100</pre> would try to connect to marge, and ask your for your password for the cs lab.</p>
  <p>From marge, you can <pre>ssh username@149.89.161.115</pre> to connect to <code>cslab4-15</code> </p>


  <h3>Classwork Repo</h3>
  <p>Please clone and use this repo to store your day to day files and a few homework assignments: <a href="https://classroom.github.com/a/B6E-H1jV">https://classroom.github.com/a/B6E-H1jV</a> </p>


    <h3>Scavenger hunt!</h3>

    <p><strong>YOU MUST NOT CLONE THIS IN YOUR HOME DIRECTORY!!!!</strong></p>

    <p>You will use your last 4 digits of your osis as your <strong>random seed</strong> so you do not forget it.</p>
    <p>
      You can continue your scavenger hunt on another machine because you can recreate the scavenger hunt with
      the same <strong>random seed</strong> as last time. You can SSH back into the lab computers, and recreate the hunt if it got deleted.
    </p>


    <p>You will be logging your scavenger hunt so please read the how to submit section!</p>
    <p>To get started:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>
    <pre><code>mkdir /tmp/`whoami`;cd /tmp/`whoami`;git clone https://github.com/pushingice/scavenger-hunt.git</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Now you must read the README carefully and follow directions.</p>
    <p>Use the last4 digits of your osis as your secret number. (random seed)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>If you get lost please use: <pre><code>cd /tmp/`whoami`/scavenger-hunt</code></pre></p>

    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Try the hunt as it is intended, and when you finish it will show you a cool method you could have hacked the hunt from the start! </p>
    <p><strong>Do not look into the python files, or use your python-fu to get your clues</strong> as that completely circumvents the purpose of this activity.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>If "which python" doesn't work as intended, try using "" as the result instead of "no python found" or similar.</p>
    </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Remember you can have more than one terminal open, for example one to display your information, and another to test commands.</p>
    <p>Note that the whoami command prints your username to stdout. The backticks insert the results of that into the terminal command.</p>

    <p>Make a file: <code>01-scavenger.txt</code> in the root of your classwork repo. </p>
    <p>This should be a plain text document no other file types!</p>
    <p>The file should contain: your name, seed, and all 12 of y our clues in the format:</p>

    <pre class="codeblock"><code>Period,Last,First
seed
problem#,LOCATION, explanation how did you get this location
problem#,LOCATION, explanation how did you get this location
...
explanation at the end</code></pre>
    <p>Your hint is exactly what you give to the nextclue command.</p>
    <p>Problem 12 requires an explanation of how you found it.</p>
    <p>After 12, please write an explanation of how easy/hard the hunt was for you, and if you used any alternative ways to find the solution(s)</p>
    <p>e.g.</p>
    <pre class="codeblock"><code>09,Smith,Kenji
0210  #the seed (secret number needed for your quest.)
1,README, Mr.K told me to go here...
2,50240, the command foo gave me the hint fish
3,12394, using ls and combining the results got the hint 123
4,54133, i used the sudo command to pwn all
...(more lines)
12,20042,????
It was hard until I decided to used magic! The magic of the terminal! (not a good response)</code></pre>
    <p>Try your best, and don't worry if you get stuck! Posting on piazza will help you un-stuck yourself.</p>
    <p>There are ways around any commands that don't work due to permissions.</p>

  <h2>Cyber Hygiene</h2>


  <h3>Terminology</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>hacker, attacker, intruder : People who seek to exploit weakness in computer systems for their own gain.</li>
    <li>vulnerability : Flaws in software, firmware, or hardware that can be exploited by anattacker to perform unauthorized operations on a system.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Hacking</h3>
  <p>~1950 MIT students. or 2024 Chinese/Russian government employees?</p>
  <p>
    The original use of the term hacker dates back to 1950-1960s at MIT.
    Students there enjoyed learning about and experimenting with technology.
    A hack was something innovative/ingenious in the arena of computers and technology.
    This positive connotation exists today in expressions like "life hacks"
    "cooking hacks" etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    This has evolved somewhat, and it is sometimes confusing because 'hacker' can
    have a positive or negative connotation: a creative engineering person, versus a cyber attacker, or even both.
  </p>
  <h3>Hacker Classification</h3>
  <p>Hackers can be classified into three different categories:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>White Hat - Ethical Hackers.
      The "good guys" that use their skills to help protect against attacks / find and report vulnerabilities / design secure systems etc.
      They have permission to try to hack into and detect vulnerabilities.
      They act in an open and professional manner to differentiate themselves from malicious hackers.

    </li>
    <li>Black Hat - Malicious Hackers.
      The "bad guys" that use their skills for malicious purposes.
      They can steal money and information or damage systems.
    </li>
    <li>Grey Hat - They do not have permission to gain access to a company's system or products,
      but find exploits with the intent of highlighting the problem. (often seeking a bounty/reward for doing so, not just going after posted bug bounties)
      They do not have malicious intent but their actions may be illegal.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2><p>What is at risk? How can you protect yourself?</p></h2>
  <h3> What are possible losses due to a cyber attack?</h3>

  <p>Let us consider the possible impacts of cyber attacks? Think what can happen if you don't protect digital data and infrastructure...</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Financial</li>
    <li>Resource Unavailability / Misuse</li>
    <li>Data Loss</li>
    <li>Identity Theft</li>
    <li>Loss of Trust/Reputation</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Identity Theft</h3>
  <p>A crime where an attacker uses information that identifies a person for personal gain. </p>

  <p><strong>Data At Risk:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Name, Address, Phone number,</li>
    <li>DOB, SSN</li>
    <li>Credit Card / Bank info</li>
    <li>Driver's License / Passport</li>
  </ul>


  <strong>Effects of Identity Theft:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Loss of money:   Bank / Credit card fraud</li>
    <li>Actual Identity: Government ID or document theft/usage</li>
  </ul>



  <h3>What can an individual do to protect themselves?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Regularly Updating OS and applications</li>
    <li>Strong Passwords</li>
    <li>Antivirus*</li>
    <li>Change default usernames and passwords</li>
    <li>Use MFA (multi factor authentication)</li>
    <li>Backup of important Files</li>
    <li>Using encryption and Digital Signatures</li>
    <li>Firewalls and intrusion detection systems</li>
    <li>Be suspicious of all email. Expected or otherwise</li>
    <li>Not revealing too much personal information on social networks</li>
    <li>Awareness of present world security scenarios and new attacks</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>*Regarding antivirus</h4>
  <p>Sometimes free antivirus isn't worth having. While Avast, AVG, and several other providers
    offer a free tier of protection, they are often filled with advertizemnts for the upgraded
    veresion of protection.</p>
  <p>Microsoft's windows defender is a great free option, but you may want to supplement that with something for your web browsing, or for additional malware detection.</p>



    <h2 id="2025-01-30h">Homework02:</h2>
  <h3>1. Your data</h3>
  <p>Back up all of your STUYCS lab data somewhere else. Your data is not protected and can be erased at any time. </p>
  <p>If you have anything that is not in a github repository, you might want to make one to store your old work (intro etc).</p>
  <p>Any GitHub repositories that you do not OWN (everything on GitHub classrooms), should be forked so you have a copy that you do in fact own, provided you wish to maintain it.</p>

  <h3>2. What you should you be doing now: (if you want to be safe)</h3>
  <p>The following are good practices that you should aim to do/start doing as soon as you can. There is no deadline and I won't check, but they will make you safer overall.</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Update all of your software</li>
  <li>Turn on multi factor authentication for all of your accounts that support it.</li>
  <li>Migrate to a password manager. (Bitwarden or similar, do NOT use LastPass)</li>
  <li>Change all of your (important) passwords to a 16+ character long randomized string using your password manager prioritizing your most important accounts and working your way down the list.</li>
  <li>Install / Update (regularly) a reputable antivirus*</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>2025-01-28</h5>

  <h2>1. Expectations and Prior Knowledge</h2>

  <h3>Language Familiarity</h3>
  <p>All students are expected to be proficient in Java/Processing, and possibly other languages as well.</p>
  <p>While you are not required to know multiple lanugages, it would allow you to pick the best tool for the job on a lab where you are allowed to use any language you choose.</p>
  <p>It is very useful to know python in addition to a more strongly typed language.</p>

  <h3>Termial Familiarity</h3>
  <p>I expect you all have had experience working with a terminal, and working with github. If you avoided using the terminal in the past, you have now run out of time to practice and will required to use it going forward.</p>
  <p>This is a good place to see some of the basic skills you will all need:   <a href="https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview">https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview</a> </p>
  <p>I will go over commands and make them part of future assignments, but doing this now (when you are not swamped with other work) would make your later portions of the class go more smoothly.</p>
  <p>You are expected to be able to use the lab machines (and hopefully your personal devices) to be able to view/edit files and more. In the lab I expect that all students would be able to create a file in a particular directory and paste/edit code fairly quickly. (e.g. Paste some code into <code>Documents/cyber/classwork/2025-01-28/Demo.java</code> ) </p>
  <p></p>

  <h3>Working environment</h3>
  <p>
    Part of this course will be making sure you are able to use a wide variety of tools.
    Even though some tools will be replicated in a web based sandbox, there are
    instances where you will need to demonstrate you can use those tools outside
    of the sandbox (from your personal device).</p>
  <p>Please ensure you have a working linux os on your personal device.</p>
  <p>If you have a mac or linux computer, you already have one!</p>
  <h3>Mac</h3>
  <p>To work on a Mac computer you must install Xcode from the App Store. Run the following in a terminal in install xcode command line tools: <pre>xcode-select --install</code></pre> </p>
  <h3>Windows</h3>
  <p>Windows users can install WSL (a linux virtual machine) on your windows computers:</p>
  <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install</a>

  <h3>Danger! Don't be stupid.</h3>
  <p>Anything you learn in this class can be used legally on your own computers, or with any computers you get permission to use. You must never "test out that cool thing" without permission.</p>
  <p>Crimes involving computers tend to be felonies and the prosecution has a lot of incentive to convict "hackers" regardless of the reasons or the scope of the crime.</p>
  <p>Please think before you act, and ask for permission before you act.</p>

  <h2>2. What is Cybersecurity?</h2>
  <p><strong>Cybersecurity are techniques and practices that are designed to protect digital data and infrastructure. </strong></p>
  <p>There are related security fields</p>
  <p>e.g. information security or even just... security.</p>
  <p>Physically securing your infrastructure is needed to protect digital things but that is beyond the scope of cybersecurity.</p>

  <h3>Why care about learning Cybersecurity?</h3>
  <p>Before going into the "what" question, let us touch upon the in-demand nature of the field.</p>
  <p>If you enjoy things in this class there are more jobs than qualified people to take them. They are well paying jobs.</p>

  <p><strong>Basically:</strong> They are paying you to play with computers!<sup>*</sup></p>
  <p>
    <strong>*</strong>if playing with computers means being passionate about learning about a highly technical
    field and wanting to use this knowledge to do good!
  </p>

  <h3>What does Cybersecurity include?</h3>
  <p>There are many categories within cybersecurity:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Application security   </strong> - programs including operating system</li>
    <li><strong>Network and infrastructure security</strong> - including web/cloud systems</li>
    <li><strong>Intrusion detection</strong></li>
    <li><strong>penetration testing</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Digital forensics and incident response</strong> - After the fact, figure out what happened, limit damage, and prevent future incidents</li>
    <li><strong>Endpoint protection and mobile security</strong> - protecting end-user devices such as desktops, laptops, and mobile devices</li>
    <li><strong>Data governance, risk and compliance</strong> - practices to comply with government or industry rules/regulations.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These are very broad categories, <strong>penetration testing </strong> for example can be broken down further:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Physical Pen Testing</strong> - Measure the effectiveness of security procedures, training, and controls by attempting physical access to an organization.</li>
    <li><strong>External Pen Testing</strong> - Find vulnerabilities that can be exploited by external attackers to access infrastructure or data.</li>
    <li><strong>Internal Pen Testing</strong> - Determining the possible impact of an attacker getting different kinds of credientials, and the level of access required to overcome the security.</li>
    <li><strong>Web App Pen Testing</strong> -  Find technical flaws or vulnerabilities in the web aplications run by an organization</li>
    <li><strong>PCI Pen Testing</strong> - (Payment Card Industry) Validating security of credit card information.  </li>
    <li><strong>Red Teaming</strong> - Simulation of a real attack using the same tactics that attacker's would employ. This is a more holistic test.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This is not mentioning the myriad of tools and techniques required. Some of which such as Cryptography are huge topics that you can study for years.</p>
